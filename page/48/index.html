				<p>Over the weekend the Blue Plate Fiancé went to Seattle to visit friends. I cooked some lovely halibut steaks.(sorry. No pictures.) We also made the pilgrimage to IKEA where I found these little <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10103&#038;storeId=12&#038;langId=-1&#038;productId=13122">tea light holders</a>.</p>
<p>They are the perfect size for a little bit of hooch, or a tastefully crafted cocktail.</p>
<p><img src='../../wp-content/uploads/2007/05/tiny-martini-glass1.jpg' alt='Tiny Martini Glass' /></p>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;ve been buying the <em>fancy</em> olives and onions for my martinis. It makes a world of difference. I&#8217;ll stop by the olive bar once in a while and get a small tub of martini-friendly-looking olives. Much, much better than those salty things that come in a jar.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not too proud to go running down the street after the bandwagon.</p>
<p>I saw the news that the rock-n-roll software developers at <a href="http://www.panic.com/" rel="self">Panic</a> were releasing a web design tool, called &#8220;<a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" rel="self">Coda</a>&#8220;, so I checked it out, ran the demo, and bought it an hour or two later.</p>
<p>I have spent about 12 hours working with it, and I&#8217;m very pleased. Coda is the quintessential Mac app, the iPod of IDEs.</p>
<p>Coda looks and feels wonderful. It&#8217;s very natural to use, and takes no time to start using effectively. I mean no-time. It is a highly learnable app. You open it up and there you are. You know what to do by looking at it. Coda is a brilliant piece of user interface design. For that matter it&#8217;s nicely designed all the way around. Even the name &#8220;Coda&#8221; is a clever double entendre.</p>
<p>A coda in music is a sort of summary of a piece. Like a big finish. Coda, the app, summarizes many aspects of web design into one tool </p>
<p>Also the word &#8220;Coda&#8221; (said out loud with a nasal Boston accent) sounds enough like <em>&#8220;coder&#8221;</em> to emphasize the nature of the tool &#8212; HTML up front, CSS up front, no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" rel="self">WYSIWYG</a> nonsense (I mean why <em>fake</em> the output when you can just look at the output in a server? Duh.)</p>
<p>Coda takes all the critical parts of web design and development and stitches them together into one tool.</p>
<p>Typically the workflow of a web developer uses the following tools:
<ul>
<li>Coding tool/text editor (for writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, etc.)</li>
<li>Web Browser (or three) for previewing how the design/development is going so far</li>
<li>FTP application to move updates to the web server</li>
<li>Command Line interface (to manage a database, version control, muck around with Apache&#8217;s configuration, etc)</li>
<li>Even yet another browser window open to do research</li>
</ul>
<p>Coda does a pretty good job of providing all of this in one application window. In practice, I still need to crack open another browser or tool for this and that (I prefer <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/" rel="self">CocoaMySQL</a> to the command-line) and I run Windows in Parallels so I can browser-beat while I&#8217;m working). In general though, it reduces my desktop clutter and the accompanying mind clutter that comes with it.</p>
<p>The net result is I only have 2 or 3 apps open instead of 5 or 6.</p>
<p>The Coda workspace has three main elements, a file browser (which shows your local site, and the remote site) and two layers of tabs.</p>
<p>One row of tabs allows access to individual files, while the top row of tabs is your &#8220;view&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" ><img class="imageStyle" alt="coda_tabs_icons" src="../../files/page0_blog_entry73_1.jpg"width="499" height="181"/></p>
<p>For any tab open, you can switch its view to any other view. Any tab may be split into frames, and each frame can have its own view.</p>
<p>This means you can have a tab split into two views, one showing your HTML, and another showing the preview (rendered by WebKit), Or you could split your tab three ways, and have your code, a preview, and a reference book open. Or you can just create a new tab (Command+T) which defaults to an empty HTML file&#8230;switch it to preview, and type in the address of your local dev server and see the site live. It&#8217;s very flexible.</p>
<p>The text editor view is based on <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaengine/" rel="self">Subetha Edit</a>. It has just enough bells and whistles to make you productive without burdening you with learning a giant tool.</p>
<p>The obvious comparisons will be to TextMate and BBEdit. This is wrong.</p>
<p>BBEdit is a Mac Text Editing <em>Platform</em> &#8212; meaning that while, yes you can use it out of the box, it&#8217;s designed to be scripted, tweaked, and customized for all those random jobs you need a swiss army program for.</p>
<p>TextMate is a code editing beast which can handle any flavor of code you throw at it, and can be infinitely tweaked for your particular coding habits.</p>
<p>Both are great*, but overkill for websites. The issue isn&#8217;t how well they handle code, they do it very well. The issue is that BBEdit and TextMate are conceptual islands which you have to leave each time you want to see the results of your work.</p>
<p>As for text editing, Coda auto-completes your HTML tags, auto-completes your PHP functions, and auto-matches your quotes and brackets, then it just gets out of your way.</p>
<p>If <em>you</em> need a super powerhouse app to manage your code, Coda isn&#8217;t your tool. Coda is there when you want to make a web site, not author forty five new classes to go into your ever growing home grown code vault.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the key. Coda is iPod-esque in that it trims out everything you don&#8217;t need to get the job done. This enhances its usability and enhances your ability to focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>I found working in Coda to be far more productive. I could see everything I was working on, I didn&#8217;t need to bounce around to get to other &#8216;views&#8217; of my work, which left me more focused and productive (and less likely to get distracted by some goofy web site on the way)</p>
<p>Coda organizes projects into &#8220;sites&#8221; which allow you to specify your local working directory, a remote FTP directory, and a remote terminal shell if you wish. Everything but the local directory is mandatory.  (Coda will open and edit any old file you point it to. You don&#8217;t have to stick it in a &#8216;site&#8217;)</p>
<p>Coda provides a &#8216;live&#8217; preview of your site &#8212; which generates a tiny little actual thumbnail of your web site. <em>Slick.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" ><a href="http://blog.abouthalf.com/page/48/assets/coda_workspace.jpg" rel="self"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Coda Sites View" src="../../files/CodaWorkspacw.jpg"width="350" height="195"/></a></p>
<p>My only gripe is that Coda doesn&#8217;t allow you specify a <em>local</em> web server for previewing PHP (or other server side languages). I work around this by opening a new tab, and just browsing to my local server. Easy enough, but it would be nice to have your preview be smart enough to run PHP files off a local server.</p>
<p>Coda is very inexpensive. The promotional price is $79, but it appears it will bump up to $99 in the future. $99 is <em>cheap</em>.</p>
<p>I was waffling about whether or not to upgrade my aging copy of Dreamweaver to the next version &#8212; after trying Coda out, Dreamweaver will not be getting upgraded.</p>
<p>At full price it&#8217;s half the cost of a Dreamweaver <em>upgrade</em>, and it does all the important things Dreamweaver does. </p>
<p>Dreamweaver has many more features, but exponentially more bloat. I would argue that the &#8220;features&#8221; are actually &#8220;crap&#8221;, but that&#8217;s another topic. The only thing I&#8217;ve used Dreamweaver for in years is having a decent HTML/CSS editor with a file manager and an FTP program. Coda has this in spades.</p>
<p>Tha&#8217;s right. You heard me. Coda is a Dreamweaver killah. Expect Macrodobe to come up with a look-a-like in 2008.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:11px; ">* I own and run both BBEdit and TextMate regularly. They are must-haves for any developer on a Mac.</span></p>

				<p>The other night I had some fish in danger of going south if I didn&#8217;t prepare it soon, so I cracked open the Julia Child Cookbook (circa 1964. Seriously.) and looked up some fish poaching recipes.</p>
<p>I modified a recipe for white wine poached white fish where the fish could be trout, or whatever. I happened to have tilapia on hand.</p>
<p>The recipe called for a white sauce made with the poaching liquid, once the fish had been cooked.</p>
<p>This was a new thing for me. I&#8217;ve made white sauces with milk dozens of times…but I hadn&#8217;t tried it with wine.</p>
<p>The sauce starts like you might expect, with a roux made from butter and flour. You want roughly equal amounts of each – around a tablespoon per.</p>
<p>To make a roux, melt butter over medium heat, then whisk in the flour. Cook this for about a minute, it will start to turn slightly brown and smell nutty.</p>
<p>To this, I added the poaching liquid, which was 1 cup of wine and just short of a cup of water (plus all the fishy goodness).</p>
<p>The hot liquid from poaching, and the hot roux come together really well. In the future, I&#8217;ll warm up my liquids before making sauce. It really helps.</p>
<p>I whisked together the liquid and roux and let it come to a simmer.</p>
<p>While the sauce was simmering I separated an egg and beat the yolk with one cup of milk in a small bowl.</p>
<p>Slowly, using my whisk, I dribbled a little bit of the simmering sauce into the milk/egg mixture and stirred it up. I repeated this until the milk/egg mixture was nearly as warm as the sauce (using the very scientific finger test).</p>
<p>This process is called &#8220;tempering&#8221; which basically warms the egg yolk up slowly so it cooks, but doesn&#8217;t become solid.</p>
<p>Once the milk and egg were tempered, I mixed it all back into the sauce and whisked it gently smooth.</p>
<p>A little salt, pepper, and red pepper flake and I had a velvety smooth delicious sauce which was surprisingly light.</p>
<p>Next week I&#8217;ll be trying the same technique with poached salmon. If it goes well, pictures and recipes will follow.</p>

				<p>I had a life lesson yesterday in aging.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 32 years old. By no means old, but certainly not a spring chicken.</p>
<p>I was heading downstairs to take out the recycling (yes. I&#8217;m bourgeoisie) and running down the steps, dodging some other tenant&#8217;s annoying relatives on the stairs, I ducked into the basement.</p>
<p>This involves taking one (1) step down from a small landing to a concrete floor. </p>
<p>I missed that  step, and with both hands clutching bags of highly breakable expired wine bottles, I came crashing down onto both knees at once.</p>
<p>[expletive deleted]</p>
<p>Now if a young man bashes his knees into concrete he&#8217;ll hurt too. But he&#8217;ll get up and walk it off.</p>
<p>But I felt this all the way through to my neck. I hit my knees and hurt everything.</p>
<p>I like to think I&#8217;m reasonably healthy with my 15 miles of walking I do a week&hellip;but I think I may need to expand on this whole health routine thing. Maybe some kind of stretchy type yoga activities or something.</p>
<p>I mean. Dude. Ouch. That floor was <em>hard.</em></p>

				<p>I came across this item on <a href="http://daringfireball.net" rel="self">Daring Fireball</a>, an Illustrator file which mocks up <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/" rel="self">Safari&#8217;s</a> browser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_chrome" rel="self">chrome</a> for use in creating mockups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oddlaa.com/extras" rel="self">http://www.oddlaa.com/extras</a></p>
<p>This is a well executed illustration, and probably will help a lot of folks out. However if you&#8217;re doing &#8220;web design&#8221; completely in Photoshop or Illustrator you will encounter at least three major problems.</p>
<p><strong>Number one: </strong>If you are making complete*, presentation ready, design comps in Illustrator or Photoshop, you are lying to your client.</p>
<p>There I said it.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s necessary to use tools like Illustrator or Photoshop (or whatever) to make highly polished graphics for the web, if you are doing all of your design work in a graphics program you are basically making something that can never be truly executed in HTML/CSS.</p>
<p>The slick fonts, the pixel-precise layout, hairline borders, nicely tracked and kerned typography, the assumption that everything will fit nicely on a page&#8230;all lies.</p>
<p>The mockup you show your client essentially becomes part of your design contract. When you present a mockup, and the client approves, you are basically promising to deliver what you showed them. Unless you have a very savvy client who understands the difference between Photoshop and a web page, you are setting them up for disappointment, and setting yourself up for a headache.</p>
<p>Client: &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t look like what you showed me.&#8221;<br />Your Dumb Ass: &#8220;Well there are differences in capability between web browsers and blah blah blah blah zzzzzz snore ramble.&#8221;<br />Client: &#8220;Yes, but that doesn&#8217;t look like what you showed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only present mockups in HTML/CSS. Get a cheap hosting account. Put your comps online. Carry a laptop to meetings, and run them off your computer.<br />If you need to sketch or develop in Photoshop or Illustrator, fine. Do it. But don&#8217;t create a painting in Photoshop then lie and call it a web page.</p>
<p>If you present work exclusively in HTML/CSS you can do a number of things.
<ul>
<li>You can present an accurate picture of what you&#8217;re developing to your client. No surprises.</li>
<li>You can resolve potential browser display problems <em>before</em> you get to the client</li>
<li>You can create a standard set of markup from the get go&#8230;saving work later (or just use a standard markup template each time)</li>
<li>You can put the comps up on a web page, and let the client look at them at home, pass a link around to their colleagues. You know. Take advantage of the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br /></strong>If you are making purty pictures in Photoshop, you have to cut up your graphic into web-able chunks, and write all the HTML anyway. This means you&#8217;ll probably have to make an intermediate graphic file to support your specific needs &#8212; like backgrounds for tabs that allow for expansion, or a template for header graphics that may change from page to page. Why do <em>more</em> work than you have to?<strong></p>
<p>Number two: </strong>Safari&#8217;s browser chrome is Apple&#8217;s intellectual property.  (And IE&#8217;s chrome is Microsoft&#8217;s intellectual property, and Firefox&#8217;s chrome is Mozilla&#8217;s intellectual property, etc)</p>
<p>Why are you stealing from Apple? Why are you putting someone else&#8217;s creative work in your portfolio? Also, unless you&#8217;ve got a hip client, they&#8217;re running Windows and probably Internet Explorer. Why are you showing them a browser they don&#8217;t recognize?</p>
<p>Why are you showing your client a picture of a web browser at all? It&#8217;s 2007. If you are making a web site for somebody, they know what a web browser looks like. You don&#8217;t need to stick a picture of a web site in a picture of a web browser. Design in HTML/CSS and put it on the web, and ta-da it will be in a web browser automatically when they look at <em>in their web browser</em>.</p>
<p>If you need to put a picture of your web design into print, or on a web page (and you can&#8217;t just link to a comp somewhere) leave out the browser chrome altogether. Your portfolio will have a title that says something like &#8220;web design&#8221; &#8212; or better yet you&#8217;ll actually have a description of the project which will indicate that it was a website and not something that only looks like a web site.</p>
<p><strong>Number three:</strong> Pictures of web sites do not tell the entire story.</p>
<p>Chances are very good that your web design will include at least some level of interactivity. 
<ul>
<li>Maybe your navigation highlights when you move the mouse over it.</li>
<li>Maybe you have a handsome (standards compliant) drop down menu.</li>
<li>Maybe you have a form or two with some nice AJAX-y elements.</li>
<li>Maybe you want to show how the design holds up at different screen resolutions, or how the type scales easily.</li>
<li>Maybe you&#8217;ve designed a really nice print stylesheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>While you can show all of these things in a picture, you&#8217;ll need many images to do it even marginally well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s far less work, and tells a much better story to your client, to say &#8220;now click here&#8221; than to say &#8220;in this picture we show the initial state&#8221; [flip flip] &#8220;and in this picture we show the active or clicked state&#8221; [flip flip] &#8220;and in this picture we show the blah blah&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, if you are the type of person who feels like their hands are cut off unless they have Photoshop open, this advice is going to be hard to swallow. I suggest &#8212; as a form of therapy &#8212; to do your designs the <s>stupid</s> old fashioned way, then convert them to HTML before showing them to your client. That way you&#8217;re only wasting time.</p>
<p>Sooner or later someone will demand a printout. It&#8217;s unavoidable. In that case you should still do all your work in HTML/CSS then screen capture the results. Place the screen capture on a page, scale it down so it doesn&#8217;t look to jaggy, and include a URL underneath it that points to the real thing. That way you&#8217;re indicating that the real thing is available elsewhere, and this print out is just the merest shadow of the actual glory of your design.</p>
<p>* I don&#8217;t mean prototyping. If you&#8217;re doing prototyping, it&#8217;s nice to have a paper version that people can scribble on in meetings. But doing a final design isn&#8217;t a prototype.</p>
