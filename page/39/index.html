				<p>Recently I admonished the Twitters to fear <a href="http://twitter.com/device55/status/14006618049">my salmon log</a>.</p>
<p>While perhaps laden with entendre, this does capture a bit of the prep-work I did over the last day and a half catering a friend&#8217;s bridal shower.</p>
<p>I knocked off of work early to go shopping.</p>
<div id="attachment_648" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-648" title="beans and taters" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/beans-and-taters-360x480.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Green beans land artistically among the potatoes while shopping.</p></div>
<p>I spent the rest of the afternoon preparing food to cook the next day.</p>
<div id="attachment_651" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-651" title="salmon log" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/salmon-log-360x480.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Salmon roulade after preparation</p></div>
<p>I decided to try out making a salmon roulade, and cooking it sous-vide style. I layered two skinned salmon fillets together, with chopped fresh spinach in between, lightly seasoned with salt.</p>
<p>This assembly was rolled tightly into many layers of plastic wrap, creating a salmon log. I left this in the fridge over night. The following day, I cooked it sous-vide style by dropping the whole log, still wrapped, into a big roasting pan and  covered it with warm water. On the stovetop I brought the water up to 125º F and left it there for an hour (periodically adjusting the temperature by removing some hot water, and adding cold).</p>
<p>When it was done, I carefully sawed the log into disks with a bread knife (plastic wrap and all) and deposited the disks onto a serving platter.</p>
<p>The piece(s) I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">stole</span> sampled were quite good. Very moist and tender. To the platter I added a tidy stack of blanched purple asparagus and a nest of blanched green beans. At the party I included a lemon and rosemary aioli for dipping, seasoning, or spooning into your face when no one is looking.</p>
<p>I also tried out making some twice baked potatoes. I boiled two small bags of potatoes,  then let them cool. Once cool enough to handle I cut them all in half lengthwise-y and laid the halves out on cooking sheets. Then, using a little spoon, I scooped out the innards into a bowl, leaving the potato shells on the cookie sheets.</p>
<p>To the potato innards, I added salt, pepper, sour cream, heavy whipping cream, 4oz of melted butter, and dill. I whipped this into a smooth consistency with a hand mixer, then piped it back into the potato shells. I baked these (400º F) for about 30 minutes, until browned. I served these with a small dollop of caviar on top.</p>
<div id="attachment_650" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-650" title="Potatoes and Slamon" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/detail-360x480.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Potatoes and salmon</p></div>
<p>I also made roasted vegetable skewers (with two more flavored aiolis) , crab and avocado dip, and two loaves of bread (with a selection of cheeses to go with).</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;m proud of myself.</p>
<div id="attachment_652" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-652" title="the spread" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/the-spread-480x360.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ready for guests</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, this was a bridal shower, so I didn&#8217;t get to hang around and eat my food (unless I was willing to dress as a fireman and dance).</p>

						<div class="entry total-208  ">
				<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to try out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide">sous-vide</a> cooking methods for a while now. Once the technique was written up in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/magazine/14CRYOVAC.html">New York Times</a> a few years ago, it has become the next big thing among home chefs.</p>
<p>There are now home sous-vide &#8216;<a href="http://www.sousvidesupreme.com/">water ovens</a>&#8216; which are within the price range of your average yuppie, but still not something I want to spend money on. ($500 will buy a lot of food and drink. Also an iPad.)</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not in the market for a $4000 laboratory quality thermal water circulator or a $500 dollar yuppie toy, I figured I was out of the running until I saw an article about people using coolers for low temperature cooking.</p>
<p>Well duh. Coolers are big insulated boxes and will keep hot things hot just as well as keeping cold things cold. You might have add some hot water to the cooler from time to time to manage the temperature, but it should be as simple as bringing water up to temperature on the stove top, sealing up some food in a bag, putting the whole mess into a cooler, and waiting.</p>
<p>I decided to do a small scale test with my thermos, which is like my cooler, just smaller. If I messed up, the worst thing that would happen is that I have to put the food into the oven to finish cooking it.</p>
<div id="attachment_641" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-641" title="mise en place" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/mise-en-place-360x480.jpg" alt="Mise en place" width="360" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mise en place</p></div>
<p>My thermos has a convenient flip-top lid which allows me to insert a probe thermometer inside without removing the lid. It&#8217;s also big enough for a steak.</p>
<p>I bought a 12oz New York steak, rinsed it, patted it dry, seasoned it with salt and pepper, then shoved it into a Ziploc bag with a splash of Worcestershire, lime juice, and olive oil. When you are trying to seal up food in a bag and make it as air tight as possible, it helps to have a little liquid in the bag &#8211; assuming you don&#8217;t have a food vacuum-bagger-device.</p>
<p>You can get a near vacuum in a Ziploc bag by sealing up the bag, leaving one end open and submerging the bag slowly into a bowl of water, leaving the open end just up above the water. As the bag sinks, the water pressure pushes the air out of the bag. When the opening of the bag is just at the surface of the water, seal up the bag, creating a near vacuum inside the bag.</p>
<p>I heated water on the stove top to 145º F &#8211; I wanted my steak to be medium rare at about 130º F &#8211; the higher temperature allows for both a small amount of heat loss from the thermos and for the fact that the relatively cold steak will cool off the water a little bit. I dropped the steak-in-a-bag into the thermos and poured the water on top.</p>
<div id="attachment_639" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-639" title="in the oven" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/in-the-oven-350x480.jpg" alt="In the 'water oven'" width="350" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In the &#39;water oven&#39;</p></div>
<p>I put the lid on top, covered it with a tea-towl, and threw a bowl on top for good measure (to help keep the heat in).</p>
<p>And then I waited.</p>
<p>40 minutes later this emerged:</p>
<div id="attachment_638" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-638" title="bowl of meat" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/bowl-of-meat-475x479.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="479" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#39;s a bowl of meat</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">This didn&#8217;t look terribly appetizing, but I patted the steak dry and seared it in clarified butter and then WOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_640" style="width: 389px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-640" title="medium rare" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/medium-rare-379x480.jpg" alt="Medium rare" width="379" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Medium rare</p></div>
<p>Perfectly medium rare, with a nice crust on the outside. Also, delicious. Best steak I&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p>(These photos kind of suck. I discovered my good camera&#8217;s battery was dead right as I was going to take a picture, so these are all crappy iPhone shots)</p>

				<p>The city of Portland has been slowly, <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=36366">steadily repaving NW 23rd</a>.

<p>It&#8217;s been fun to watch the construction. They close down a few blocks at a time and excavate the street. In the process old streetcar rails have been been dug up.</p>
<p>In one place, the old tracks peeked out from underneath the end of the uncut street.</p>

<p><em>You shouldn&#8217;t have.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m putting the finishing touches on a new WordPress theme. It&#8217;s still a little rough in places, comments need formatting, lists need sweetening, various twiddles need to be twaddled. But it&#8217;s mostly there, so why not take it for a test run?</p>
<p>This theme is fully &#8216;widgetized&#8217; (to use the WordPress nomenclature) which means it&#8217;s a lot easier to customize. I&#8217;m also working on a few fun little tricks like shortcodes (like for the image above) to allow for a little more aesthetic control of the published web content (while not borking the internal tools)</p>
<p>I have a couple of goals with this design: Use nice typography and keep it minimal. I realize the primary way people interact with a website nowadays is to follow a link from somewhere to the specific article. That link might be in an RSS feed reader, a search result, a twitter posting, or whatever. Very few people are going to websites directly to browse for content. </p>
<p>This has two implications: Reading is your user&#8217;s first priority. Searching is probably second, and actual clicking around on the site is a distant third (maybe fourth if you have some funny pictures of cats).</p>
<p>With this in mind I decided to keep the navigation minimal, and present the content front and center. Archives are off on their own page now (it&#8217;s widgetized, I could bring them back whenever), ancillary links are down at the bottom for when a reader gets done reading.</p>
<h3>Technical Notes</h3>
<p>Right now this theme should work in modern browsers including Internet Explorer 7 and 8. Internet Explorer 6 is probably making a mess of this site. I&#8217;m not sure if I care or not.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that this type ain&#8217;t Arial. I&#8217;m using new-ish font embedding techniques which should be rendering everything in a lovely Bodoni-esque typeface for you, unless you&#8217;re using an ancient version of Safari or Firefox. I am using <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a> to create font kits. They host many open source or non-licensed fonts and provide a tool to roll your own font kits. </p>
<p>The rest of the theme is straight-forward HTML and CSS with a minor bit of tweaking to some default WordPress functions.</p>

Bill, we pulled that guy in last night. When you mentioned his blog, I emailed the hosting provider and asked for an IP address. Told them I could get a warrant, but they just volunteered. Turns out all the previous logins were from the same IP, routed back to the local cable internet service provider. So I called them up and got physical address and the boys picked him up before dinner. He&#8217;s in lock-up now.</p>

				<p>I was recently directed to this article by (national treasure) Roger Ebert: <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/11/the_pot_and_how_to_use_it.html">http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/11/the_pot_and_how_to_use_it.html</a></p>
<p>In it, Mr. Ebert writes about the humble, yet powerful, rice cooker.</p>
<p>I had always shunned rice cookers. When people would talk about how great their rice cooker was I would snark &#8220;I have a rice cooker. It&#8217;s also called a &#8216;pot&#8217;. The nice part is, it&#8217;s also a pot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have similar feelings about oven mitts. I have an oven mitt. It&#8217;s called a &#8216;towel&#8217;. The benefit of using a towel, is it&#8217;s <em>also</em> a towel.*</p>
<p>I can make a good pot of rice in a standard pot. I can make a nice risotto too.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Ebert&#8217;s blog changed my tune.</p>
<p>Yes, the rice cooker can cook rice. It can also cook anything that needs to be steamed or cooked in water.</p>
<p>I worship at the alter of our Lady of the Ladle, Julia Child, but I&#8217;ve been wanting to broaden my horizons and eat more vegetarian and generally healthier dishes.</p>
<p>I purchased a 6 cup Zojirushi rice cooker with a steamer basket. It makes darn good rice. It also cooks beans to perfection. Tonight it made me a lovely batch of quinoa.</p>
<p>Quinoa (keeeeeeen wah) is a small little grain that when cooked has a nutty flavor and a pleasant texture.</p>
<p>Quinoa makes excellent salad. The small grains are fairly dense and when cooked they tend to stick together a bit. This allows you to mix all kinds of various things in without them all settling to the bottom.</p>
<div id="attachment_274" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-274 " title="quinoa salad" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_0015-300x198.jpg" alt="Quinoa salad" width="300" height="198" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Quinoa salad </p></div>
<p>This lovely salad is a mix of quinoa, shredded lettuce, fresh parsley, kidney beans, peas, onion, garlic, feta, salt, pepper, paprika, dill, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. All to taste.</p>
<p>Hearty and filling but not heavy. Nice mix of textures and flavors. Lovely while still slightly warm, good chilled. Highly portable for lunches.</p>
<p>*<small>Yes, I know where my towel is.</small></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been learning about baking bread. </p>
<p>This all started by reading (most of) the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ratio-Simple-Behind-Everyday-Cooking/dp/1416566112/">Ratio</a> &#8211; which is a fantastic book about the fundamentals of cooking. I bought the Kindle version of this book for my iPhone so I could read it on the train &#8211; which is great &#8211; but it&#8217;s also horrible because I don&#8217;t mind getting buttery fingerprints on a cookbook but I do mind dropping my $400 toy into a bowl of wet dough.</p>
<p>From this book I learned that bread was not that mysterious and started making a few loaves.</p>
<p>After that I started learning a little bit more. The internets are full of <a href="http://www.thefreshloaf.com/lessons/tentipsforbetterfrenchbread">wonderful</a>, sloppy, contradictory <a href="http://sourdough.com/video/single-fold-shaping-wet-dough-milawa-factory">information</a> about bread making.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve learned a few things which I didn&#8217;t really understand before. e.g. Kneading is an option, not a requirement.</p>
<p>Before I tried any bread making I had run across a couple of &#8220;no knead&#8221; bread recipes. My gut feeling was that this was some hocus-pocus nonsense that resulted in some bread-ish product that wasn&#8217;t very good.</p>
<p>I was as surprised as anyone to discover that I was wrong.</p>
<p>The first several loaves I made were good. They looked good, tasted good, they were good. But I wasn&#8217;t getting that big open crumb you see at the fancy bakery. I thought maybe I wasn&#8217;t kneading enough, or I wasn&#8217;t letting it rise enough, or something. The problem was that I misunderstood kneading and bread.</p>
<p>Bread &#8211; not a cracker, pie crust, cake, or biscuit &#8211; is the way it is because it is built from an intertwined web of gluten. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten">Gluten</a> is what happens when the proteins in wheat get together with water and have a party. The resulting aftermath is a stringy network of proteins. Water also breaks down some of the starches in bread into simple sugars. When yeast shows up to the party, yeast is all like &#8216;sup sugar, chows down, and farts out carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The web of gluten holds the yeast farts in. Once the bread is baked, gluten hardens, the yeast is killed (the glorious bastards), but the shell of their fart bubbles remain as the only evidence of their existence. This also makes bread spongey, sproingy, and delicious.</p>
<p>So to make bread you have to have <em>some</em> water. If there&#8217;s a lot of water molecules can just slip and slide around, the yeast gets fed, and gluten forms all by itself. This takes some time &#8211; like 12 hours or better &#8211; but it happens all by itself.</p>
<p>If you have relatively little water, you have to help things along with kneading. Kneading is like pouring your shy protein molecules a drink (of water) and forcing them to dance. Yeast goes along for the ride. Yeast likes to party. </p>
<p>When there&#8217;s a lot of water, the naturally formed gluten network is random, open, and irregular. </p>
<p>When you knead bread you are mechanically forcing the creation of this network, which usually results in a much tighter and compact network of yeast fart bubbles.</p>
<p>This is your classic trade off. </p>
<p>If you want a tight, well structured dough that you can shape into anything you want (and have it ready to eat in a couple of hours), then you knead.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got time to kill and you want something flavorful, rustic, with big holes you can fill with olive oil &#8211; you go for the no-knead-let-it-rest-in-a-bowl-overnight method and let the magic happen.</p>
<p>There are, of course, places in between on this spectrum.</p>

				<p>Recently a friend of a friend generously invited me (and my friend) to join for a whisky tasting at his place. We each brought a bottle or two and our host took a stab at arranging our whiskies from sweet to peaty &#8211; we began with a couple of bourbons, moved to some Irish whiskies, sampled a few Oregon whiskies in between, and landed firmly into Scotch.</p>
<p>We tasted each whisky first by smell. Whisky is commonly drunk from an old fashioned glass, which is just fine, but if you want to get a nose full of yummy aromas, try a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencairn_Whisky_Glass">whisky glass</a>. The narrower opening concentrates the aromas so you can get a good whiff. Hold the opening of the glass a good 6 inches from your nose. That way you can enjoy the smell, but not inhale alcohol fumes and set your nostrils on fire.</p>
<p>Following the smell we sipped just a tiny bit &#8211; enough to wet the tongue &#8211; and then inhaled deeply through our nose (mouth shut tight). This has the effect of combining the aromas and the taste at once.</p>
<p>After all this silliness we just drank the shot.</p>
<p>Someone had the bright idea that we should write down some notes as what we thought about each whisky. Someone else had the bright idea that we should share the prices of each bottle so we could remember later what we liked and how much it would cost us to enjoy it again.</p>
<p>And now I have the bright idea to share it all with the internets. Hopefully this will introduce someone to something new and delicious.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Eagle Rare Bourbon 10 year &#8211; $28</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Sweeter than expected (but not too sweet)</li>
<li>Smelled and tasted of licorice, cherry, and cinnamon</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Corner Creek Bourbon &#8211; $28</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Nicely sweet, slightly spicy</li>
<li>Grassy, fresh aroma with fruit</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Bushmills Malt 21 &#8211; $116</dt>
<dd>
<p>This was the most expensive whisky we tried that night &#8211; I was pleasantly surprised. My only exposure to Irish Whisky has been cheap stuff at pubs</p>
<ul>
<li>Smells and tastes of vanilla and Anise</li>
<li>Very, dangerously smooth</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Bushmills 1608 400th Anniversary &#8211; $70</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Bright aroma, almost citrus</li>
<li>Taste of vanilla and cherry</li>
<li>Also dangerously smooth</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a href="http://clearcreekdistillery.com/whiskey.html">McCarthy&#8217;s 2009</a> &#8211; $50</dt>
<dd>
<p>This was the first Oregon whisky we tried &#8211; again I was pleasantly surprised. I had tried some regional whisky once before and thought it was frankly awful. (I won&#8217;t name names). The McCarthy&#8217;s was quite good and each year varies quite a bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong aromas of peat and smoke</li>
<li>Flavors of grain (like bread) and butter</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.rogue.com/spirits/dead-guy-whiskey.php">Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey</a> &#8211; $56</dt>
<dd>
<p>I had mixed feelings about this whisky &#8211; it&#8217;s made with the same grains used in Dead Guy Ale. It&#8217;s tasty, very drinkable &#8211; but I hesitate to call it &#8220;good&#8221;- it&#8217;s more interesting. Like if a beer graduated to whiskey but not with honors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peppery flavor</li>
<li>Not very aromatic</li>
<li>Quite smooth and sip-able</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>McCarthy&#8217;s 2008 &#8211; $50 (not that you&#8217;ll find any)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Very distinct from the 2009 &#8211; which is very Oregon of them. Wines very from year to year, because the weather changes, the landscape changes, etc. This Oregon whisky is the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>Light aroma of peat and smoke, but with the addition of caramel</li>
<li>Tastes just a little like a crème brûlée</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>A&#8217;bunadh &#8211; $67</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a cask strength whisky, meaning it isn&#8217;t cut with water before bottling. This means it will be approximately 60% alcohol by volume or 120 proof. It can be drank straight &#8211; but really should have a splash of water.</p>
<p>A&#8217;bunadh is made in small batches, and each batch (roughly one batch per year) can differ greatly from the year before. Each bottle is numbered with its batch. (I cleverly forgot to write the batch number down &#8211; but I think it was 26)</p>
<ul>
<li>Aromas of burning wax candles and peat</li>
<li>Surprisingly sweet &#8211; I think in part due to the high alcohol concentration &#8211; but with a hint of fruit</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Laphroaig 10 year &#8211; $50</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the bottle I brought to the event &#8211; it&#8217;s the scotch I first grew to really enjoy. It&#8217;s an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay">Islay</a> scotch which means peaty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peaty&#8221; is a hard quality to describe &#8211; you definitely know it when you taste it. It&#8217;s strong and aromatic. Smokey yet slightly vegetative. It tastes like walking through a wet pine forest on fire.</p>
<p>Peaty scotches are often considered for &#8220;advanced&#8221; drinkers and it&#8217;s definitely an acquired taste. Once you acquire it though you&#8217;ll turn your nose up at the various colors of Johnny Walker.</p>

				<p>I updated my Mac with OS X 10.6 last night and the process went very smoothly without any problems. Apple does a good job with OS upgrades and installs, and they almost always go very smoothly. Most users can just pop in the disk, click the button, restart and go.</p>
<p>In my case, I use my Mac for web development in PHP so I had a couple of extra tasks to perform.</p>
<p>I prefer to use the internal Apache 2 web server provided by Apple &#8211; mostly because it can be enabled and disabled with a click on a System Preference panel and the built in system log browser (Console.app) reports errors in Apache and PHP. Handy.</p>
<p>In the past I used pre-built and packaged PHP module from <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/">Mark Liyanage</a> &#8211; his package is the defacto standard for PHP development on a Mac, it&#8217;s linked from the <a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php">PHP.net</a> site directly. Mark&#8217;s packages always work very well and have anything and everything you could want in a PHP binary. His packages are intended to work with the built in apache web server.</p>
<p>But Mark is only one man, and he can&#8217;t be expected to crank out a PHP package the same day a new operating system is released. Man&#8217;s got to eat.</p>
<p>Apple has bundled PHP (along with Ruby, Java, Python, and other developer tools) with Mac OS X from the beginning. However Apple&#8217;s versions of PHP are not always the most current, or may be missing features. Fore example, in OS X 10.5 Apple didn&#8217;t include PDO drivers for MySQL &#8211; which is a weird thing to leave out &#8211; but there you go. Thus most developers either compile their own versions of PHP (and ruby, and python, etc) or rely on a prepackaged binary.</p>
<p>However this time around, Apple&#8217;s included version of PHP is up to date and full featured (enough to be useful).</p>
<p>PHP 5.3 is included in Mac OS X 10.6 by default and this time they didn&#8217;t forget the PDO drivers for MySQL. Whee! Here is the configure command from the built in PHP on my system:</p>
<pre>'/var/tmp/apache_mod_php/apache_mod_php-53~1/php/configure'
'--prefix=/usr'
'--mandir=/usr/share/man'
'--infodir=/usr/share/info'
'--disable-dependency-tracking'
'--sysconfdir=/private/etc'
'--with-apxs2=/usr/sbin/apxs'
'--enable-cli'
'--with-config-file-path=/etc'
'--with-libxml-dir=/usr'
'--with-openssl=/usr'
'--with-kerberos=/usr'
'--with-zlib=/usr'
'--enable-bcmath'
'--with-bz2=/usr'
'--enable-calendar'
'--with-curl=/usr'
'--enable-exif'
'--enable-ftp'
'--with-gd'
'--with-jpeg-dir=/BinaryCache/apache_mod_php/apache_mod_php-53~1/Root/usr/local'
'--with-png-dir=/BinaryCache/apache_mod_php/apache_mod_php-53~1/Root/usr/local'
'--enable-gd-native-ttf'
'--with-ldap=/usr'
'--with-ldap-sasl=/usr'
'--enable-mbstring'
'--enable-mbregex'
'--with-mysql=mysqlnd'
'--with-mysqli=mysqlnd'
'--with-pdo-mysql=mysqlnd'
'--with-mysql-sock=/var/mysql/mysql.sock'
'--with-iodbc=/usr'
'--enable-shmop'
'--with-snmp=/usr'
'--enable-soap'
'--enable-sockets'
'--enable-sysvmsg'
'--enable-sysvsem'
'--enable-sysvshm'
'--with-xmlrpc'
'--with-iconv-dir=/usr'
'--with-xsl=/usr'
'--with-pcre-regex=/usr'</pre>
<p>Look at all those goodies. This has everything I need for my current development needs, so I didn&#8217;t bother with building my own PHP.</p>
<p>Before I began the upgrade process I made a copy of my apache configuration files. By default, apache on OS X creates a configuration file for each user account on the computer. These configuration files can be found in /etc/apache2/users/ and are named with your short user name, followed by &#8220;.conf&#8221; e.g. &#8220;username.conf&#8221;</p>
<p>I keep all of my apache development configurations in my user configuration file, so I just made a copy of that file and stashed it on my desktop.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m comfortable mucking about in the command line, I&#8217;m a visual person and I prefer to see what I&#8217;m doing. Mac OS X typically hides the unix system files in the Finder &#8211; this prevents horrible accidents &#8211; but you can still use the Finder to dig around in the hidden file system.</p>
<p>In the Finder (i.e. click the desktop) select the &#8220;Go&#8221; menu at the top of the screen, look for the &#8220;Go to folder…&#8221; option.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-246" title="go-to-folder" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/go-to-folder.png" alt="go-to-folder" width="335" height="360" /></p>
<p>This will bring up the following screen, where you can type the file path you want. You can even tab-complete path names.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-248" title="Go" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/go-screen.png" alt="Go" width="509" height="229" /></p>
<p>Now you can browse all those sneaky hidden files, right-click them and edit them in TextMate</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-249" title="Apache2 folder" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/apache2_folder.png" alt="Apache2 folder" width="625" height="454" /></p>
<p>From here I could just drag the httpd.conf file to my desktop, and then dig into the users directory find my configuration file, and drag that to the desktop.</p>
<p>Next I made a back up of my MySQL databases by opening Terminal and typing:</p>
<p>
<pre><code>mysqldump -u root -p<em>password</em> --all-databases &gt; mysql_backup.sql</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Naturally you should use your own MySQL root password and not &#8220;password&#8221;. Naturally. This backup includes user tables as well as your databases, allowing you to reimport the whole kielbasa.</p>
<p>I ran a manual TimeMachine backup one more time to make sure I got everything backed up and then I ran the OS X 10.6 installer. Point. Click. Wait. Restart. Restart. Done. Easy.</p>
<p>After the update was done, I downloaded a new 64 bit intel installer for MySQL 5.0 here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#macosx-dmg &#8211; the site indicates OS X 10.5 but it works fine in 10.6</p>
<p>I reinstalled MySQL, the StartupItem, and the System Preference panel. From the command line I ran the following to reimport all of my data and users:</p>
<p>
<pre><code>mysql --user=root --password=<em>password</em> &lt; mysql_backup.sql</code></pre>
</p>
<p>The 10.6 installer honored my existing apache configuration files, so I didn&#8217;t actually have to replace those. But if you have never enabled PHP, simply go to /etc/apache2/ and edit httpd.conf in TextMate (TextMate will ask for your administrator password to save the file). Look for the line which reads:</p>
<p>
<pre><code>#LoadModule php5_module        libexec/apache2/libphp5.so</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Remove the pound sign (#) and save the file.</p>
<p>The default PHP installation on Mac OS X does not ship with a php.ini file. You&#8217;ll need to create one in order to configure PHP to find MySQL.</p>
<p>Go to /etc using the &#8220;Go&#8221; menu as indicated above. You should see a file entitled php.ini.default. Open this file in TextMate and save as &#8220;php.ini&#8221;</p>
<p>Set the server time zone by searching for &#8220;date.timezone&#8221; and setting the appropriate time zone ID from the lists here: <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php">http://us2.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the west coast, so I use <code>date.timezone = America/Los_Angeles</code></p>
<p>Note that there are no quotes around the time zone ID.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to point PHP to the mysql.sock file. The default values are incorrect. Search for &#8220;mysql.sock&#8221; and change each configuration to point to /tmp/mysql.sock &#8211; you should find three instances to change.</p>
<p>
<pre>pdo_mysql.default_socket=/tmp/mysql.sock</pre>
<pre>mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock</pre>
<pre>mysqli.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock</pre>
</p>
<p>(In previous versions, Mac OS X kept the mysql.sock file at /var/mysql/mysql.sock &#8211; the new location is more standard)</p>
<p>If you are a seasoned PHP developer you may wish to make other configuration changes at this time. If not, leave the rest alone.</p>
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<p>All that is left to do now is to open System Preferences, launch the MySQL system preference and start the server. Show All, select &#8220;Sharing&#8221; and check the box next to &#8220;Web Sharing&#8221; from the list of options.</p>
<p>To verify everything works &#8211; create a text file in your Sites directory called php_info.php and include the following:</p>
<p><code>&lt;?php phpinfo() ?&gt;</code></p>
<p>Load this file up in your browser at http://localhost/~username/php_info.php (replacing &#8216;username&#8217; with your user name) and you should see a nicely formatted list of all your PHP configurations.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Rob Allen has some instructions up which include configuring Xdebug &#8211; very handy: <a href="http://akrabat.com/2009/10/05/setting-up-php-mysql-on-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard/">http://akrabat.com/2009/10/05/setting-up-php-mysql-on-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard/</a></p>
