				<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-3.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-236 alignnone" title="tr.im is closing up shop" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-3-300x212.png" alt="tr.im is closing up shop" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://tr.im/">URL shortening service tr.im</a> is closing up shop, promising to maintain redirected URLs until December 2009.</p>
<p>There is a lot of noise on Twitter and tr.im&#8217;s blog about the shut down. Apparently many users were using a feature of tr.im to generate ad hoc web site statistics &#8211; which was foolish even before tr.im shut off its service.</p>
<p>There are many little remora-like services that piggy back on Twitter&#8217;s success, Twitpic, Audioboo, and various URL shorteners.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m an old timer on the internets, my first reaction when one web site asks me for my username and password for another web site (under completely different ownership no less) is to get suspicious. I wonder how hard it would be to convince people to give up their bank website username and password, if you promised to print funny pictures of cats on their checks.</p>
<p>The folks at tr.im seem to be earnestly trying to prevent their domain name from falling into the hands of spammers, which I applaud. But it&#8217;s only a matter of time before one of the other services fails and sells out, and we get a web full of link rot <em>and </em>spam.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s absurd 140 character limit is based on a primitive SMS limitation that is no longer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenated_SMS">relevant</a>. It&#8217;s this arbitrary limit which creates the need for URL shortening services in the first place, which Twitter strangely doesn&#8217;t provide internally (Twitter apparently hooks into bit.ly for URL shortening, but who knows how long that will last.)</p>
<p>If Twitter provided this service itself it would accomplish two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less link rot (if twitter dries up and blows away, so do the broken links)</li>
<li>Twitter could check for spam or malware laden links as a service to their users</li>
</ul>
<p>While I think shorter URLs are generally nicer to use (assuming they are somewhat intelligible when you read them) I think URL shortening services are just a tragedy waiting to happen.</p>
<p>A poorly authored (or a deliberately shady) URL shortening service can be used to obscure links to phishing sites, sites which try to install malware, or create links which actually contain malicious scripts themselves.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not an active Twitter user, the only &#8216;follow&#8217; requests I receive are from spammy, porny, fake twitter users with only one &#8216;tweet&#8217; &#8211; the tweet containing, of course, some shortened URL from some service I&#8217;ve never heard of. (it&#8217;s interesting that most of my actual activity on the Twitter site itself is to block these spambots from following my account).</p>
<p>The giant gaping security holes in URL shortening services notwithstanding, I am a little surprised by the number of services who&#8217;s only business model seems to be &#8220;fill in a missing feature for Twitter and worry about making money later&#8221;.</p>
<p>A simple change at Twitter, say allowing Tweets to be 255 characters long, would basically shut down a number of web sites before they ever make any money.</p>

				<p>I have constant backups made at home using Apple&#8217;s Time Machine (and it has in fact saved my butt more than once), I wanted to have the additional protection of having my files stored safely someplace other than my desk.</p>
<p>I know some folks do off site backup the old fashioned way; by duplicating their existing backup drive and storing it at a friend&#8217;s house. (In this scenario, the friend usually trusts you to store a copy of his backup too.)</p>
<p>The theory behind this approach is that the drive stored at your friend&#8217;s house should be relatively safe if your house burns down or gets broken into. And hey it&#8217;s all &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>
<p>However. I would never:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust a friend with my personal files (my friend may be trustworthy&#8230;but what about his friends? or his wife? or his kids?)</li>
<li>Burden my friend with that responsibility</li>
<li>Take on that responsibility myself (do I look stupid to you?)</li>
</ul>
<p>That whole approach, while &#8220;free&#8221; seems like a good way to get your files stolen or damaged, get your heart broken, or just ruin a friendship. Besides, how often can you really expect you and your friend to swap drives? What if you miss a week or three ? What if one of you decides to move?Â Short version: This is a stupid idea.</p>
<p>I also looked into using Amazon S3 (and companion products). S3 is a clever product and is a bargain for any company with vast storage needs. For the home consumer though, the price is prohibitive, and it&#8217;s a little clunky. I do like the idea of a web-based back up system that I can use from anywhere.</p>
<p>So, I recently signed up to use <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> for my offsite file backup provider. Blackblaze works wonderfully. It has the following killer features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Mac client</li>
<li>Cheap</li>
<li>Secure</li>
<li>Well thought out and easy to use</li>
</ul>
<p>Backblaze, at the time of this writing, charges $5 per month, per computer, for unlimited backup over the internet. Purchasing 1 year at a time costs a little less at $50. It would take me 2 to 3 years of service before I covered the cost of a new external hard drive &#8211; and external hard drives don&#8217;t come with off-site data centers, encryption, or web based file retrieval.</p>
<p><img class="push-0" title="Backblaze Menu Item Control" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-1.png" alt="Backblaze Menu Item Control" width="93" height="78" />The software installs a control panel (Mac or Windows) and a little menu bar or system tray icon which lets you quickly see status or bring up the preferences.</p>
<p>The control panel itself is very simple, with a big fat &#8220;backup now&#8221; button and a simple status report.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/bbcontrolpanel.png"><img title="Backblaze Mac OS X control panel" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/bbcontrolpanel-300x214.png" alt="Backblaze Mac OS X control panel" width="300" height="214" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking &#8220;Settingsâ¦&#8221; will allow you to throttle the upload speed, schedule backups, or customize which files are backed up.</p>
<p>Backblaze, by default, assumes you want to backup everything except some commonly not backed up files, like caches, virtual disk images, and so forth. You choose what items that you explicitly <em>do not</em> want to back up. I think this approach makes a lot more since, especially for non-technical users. In my case, I omitted my downloaded TV programs (because I throw those away after I watch them anyway), my secondary user account, and some other non critical files (folders full of aliases). It would be nice to have an &#8220;advanced&#8221; mode to specify rules for backing up certain types of files, or to finely tune the backup schedule &#8211; but it&#8217;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Blackblaze has a few limitations imposed upon what you can back up. Backblaze limits backed up files to 4GB in size, they will not back up drives mounted over a network, and versions of files are only kept for 30 days. These limitations are perfectly reasonable to me &#8211; but Backblaze goes to the trouble of explaining each of their limitations in their FAQ.</p>
<p>Once you install Backblaze you must make your initial back up. This can take a <em>long</em> time, depending upon your network speed.</p>
<p>Obviously a web based backup system is going to require a speedy internet connection.Â Most home broadband internet providers give you a pretty good download speed, but the upload speed can be poor. Backblaze includes a <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/speedtest/">bandwidth speed test</a> on their site to help you determine how long your first back up will take. Mine took about three weeks, one of those weeks I was traveling and had limited access to the internet &#8211; so I&#8217;d wager that two weeks over a home DSL connection should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Once my initial back up completed I immediately tried out a file restore to see how the system works (if you&#8217;re running any kind of back up system, you should periodically test that you can recover your files from your backup).</p>
<p>I used the web-based tool to select some arbitrary files from my backup. Backblaze presents you with a pretty nice tree-view browser to select your files. You can choose entire directories, individual files, or mix and match. Once you make your selection, Backblaze tells you you&#8217;ll get an email once your ZIP file download is ready. Mine came in about 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Following the link in the email, I discovered that not only does Backblaze keep your files, it keeps a record of the files you&#8217;ve restored. The restores are listed by date, can be downloaded again, or deleted if you don&#8217;t need them.</p>
<p>The ZIP file I downloaded retained the original directory structure of my hard drive, even though I only selected individual files, that is the zip decompressed to a folder with the name of my hard drive, with a &#8220;Users&#8221; folder, with my home folder, with a &#8220;Documents&#8221; folder, etc, etc. This would allow you to pretty easily reconstruct a destroyed system, or at the very least know where to find your files in your backup.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;m very happy with this service. I hope I never really need it.</p>

				<p>I recently left a very big corporate IT department (subject to the whims of a much greater IT department over the river and across the pond) in order to join a small technology company.</p>
<p>In my old job I was &#8220;working in IT&#8221;. In my new job, I&#8217;m working on software. The difference is astounding. I have vague memories of this difference from my days as a struggling yet clueless freelancer. Working on software and working in IT are two entirely different things no matter what the job description says.</p>
<p>In my old job I got to play with Java, .Net, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en-us&#038;q=legacy+ASP&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8">legacy garbage</a>, and a smattering of other things.</p>
<p>In my new job I&#8217;m working in PHP in the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> stack &#8211; I&#8217;m far happier.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customerthrough early and continuous deliveryof valuable software.</dt>
<dd>Because there&#8217;s nothing customers like more than half baked software.</dd>
<dt>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer&#8217;s competitive advantage.</dt>
<dd>Because scope creep allows for us to bill more.</dd>
<dt>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</dt>
<dd>We couldn&#8217;t think of 12 principles, so we cut the first one in half and used it again.</dd>
<dt>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</dt>
<dd>Not like those other methodologies where developers create software in a perfect vacuum. In Space.</dd>
<dt>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</dt>
<dd>If your project fails, you just weren&#8217;t motivated enough.</dd>
<dt>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</dt>
<dd>If we don&#8217;t write anything down, we can&#8217;t get sued.</dd>
<dt>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</dt>
<dd>Meeting goals, deadlines, and budgets don&#8217;t count</dd>
<dt>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</dt>
<dd>Sustainable, constant development means we never stop billing.</dd>
<dt>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</dt>
<dd>We maximize our ROI by redeploying developer cycles in a proactive heads-down manner using Web 2.0.</dd>
<dt>Simplicity&#8211;the art of maximizing the amount of work not done&#8211;is essential.</dt>
<dd>This is the sound of one hand coding.</dd>
<dt>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</dt>
<dd>Because bullies, loudmouths, and jerks should run every project.</dd>
<dt>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</dt>
<dd>But don&#8217;t call it a performance review.</dd>

				<p>The missus and I enjoy our AppleTV quite a bit. We have it plugged into an older tube TV (with component video plugs) and we use it to watch whatever new series we like that isn&#8217;t out on Netflix yet, and to rent movies periodically.</p>
<p>Between the AppleTV and Netflix (and the Watch Instantly feature) we have no need for cable (jerks) or a digital converter box. Oh, I have a digital converter box, but it sucks. I&#8217;d rather have snowy reception, or soon none at all.</p>

We&#8217;ll probably get one when the current TV finally dies (it&#8217;s 6 years old and going strong &#8211; no need to replace it) but I have no interest in getting a BlueRay player or subscribing to some HD cable crap.</p>
<p>I did recently get a giant new monitor for my home computer (thanks to a friend&#8217;s company selling off some old equipment for cheap) and I thought I&#8217;d like to see if the HD quality was really much different or even &#8220;better&#8221;.</p>
<p>I purchased the first episode of &#8220;<a href="http://www.sho.com/site/weeds/home.do">Weeds</a>&#8221; in HD from iTunes to check it out. We had been wanting to check out the show, and I figured a dramedy might be a good test of impact of HD. HD is usually demonstrated with action sequences, explosions, and space robots. That seems like a cheat to me. The blur of visible action will tend to dazzle at most resolutions &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to tell if you are responding to the video quality or content.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find out that when you purchase an HD television show from iTunes you actually get two files. You get the HD version of the video <em>plus</em> the standard version. Itunes itself, however, only shows you one item in your library. When iTunes synchs an HD video over to your iPhone or iPod, it will automatically select the SD version. This is so you aren&#8217;t wasting a whole gigabyte of space on your portable device for one show. I imagine that it also requires less computing horsepower to play and subsequently scale down an HD file &#8211; on a battery operated device like an iPhone that could suck up more juice and shorten the charge time.</p>
<p>In practicality though, it means you lose an extra 300-400 MB of space on your hard drive because you have two files instead of one. It did, however, let me do an apples-to-apples comparison of both versions.</p>
<p>The HD video file (MP4) weighs in at 1.02 GB &#8211; the video size being 1280 Ã 720 pixels (wide screen format), the SD video file is 376.8 MB at 853 Ã 480. The HD file is almost 3 times the file size of the SD version. The HD resolution is 150% the size of the SD resolution. So, what does that look like?</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/01/weeds_compare_large.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2009/01/weeds_compare.jpg" alt="HD Compared to SD" title="HD Compared to SD" width="400" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-196" /></a><br />
(click for full size)</p>
<p>Yep. It&#8217;s sharper and clearer. I, however, did not enjoy the episode 150% more. At least now I know that when I <em>do</em> get an HD tv I don&#8217;t have to waste money on HD content from iTunes.</p>

						<div class="entry total-212  ">
				<p>Back when I was fresh out of graduate school, I was sitting in my favorite local <a href="http://www.oldtowndraughthouse.com/">pub</a> with a <a href="http://www.stillbook.org/">buddy</a> of mine. We were talking about navigating the bureaucracy of a typical graduate art program. That or girls. Probably girls.</p>
<p>At some point in the conversation, after my friend had described a vexing problem, I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is, you want it to be some way it&#8217;s not.</p></blockquote>
<p>We both laughed because this was obvious, trite, and exactly true.</p>
<p>I think this idea applies equally well to the seemingly never ending dust-up regarding the fact that Apple will only sell iPhone apps through their store, on their terms, and have had the audacity to (oh noes) reject some apps from being sold in their store.</p>
<p>This is like complaining that your free ice cream doesn&#8217;t have sprinkles &#8212; I simply don&#8217;t understand the brouhaha.</p>
<p>I think, though, it might come down to this: When Apple announced the iPhone, we were told that it was running OS X and that it connected to the internet via WiFi. Technical folks understood that this implied that the iPhone&#8211;despite having a dirty, dirty, cellular radio&#8211;was basically a really tiny UNIX machine <em>and</em> a really tiny (though not especially powerful) Macintosh computer. Cool!</p>
<p>Immediately great hordes of nerds imagined a Narnia-esque world where anyone could write an iPhone app and a winged, talking, lion would ferry him across a great river of nymphs so he might sell his app to his queen.</p>
<p>However, Apple decided to make money. So, they created a controlled product and &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; (I hate that word when applied to &#8220;product accessories&#8221;). This means that all things iPhone (3rd party or not) work reasonably well together and give off the fresh baked aroma of <em>quality</em> that Apple is known for.</p>
<p>When the fantasy did not become a reality there was great wailing and gnashing of teeth. Simply, people were upset because things were not the way they wanted them to be.</p>
<p>It is technically feasible to sell the iPhone as a general purpose mobile/cellular/computing platform. That this technical feasibility exists, and that Apple does not choose to pursue it, drives some folks to conniptions.</p>
<p>In response many people yelled &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en-us&#038;q=iphone+monopoly&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8">Monopoly</a>!&#8221;. I can only assume they are upset because they didn&#8217;t get to play the car piece (I always choose the hat) because they clearly don&#8217;t understand what that word actually means.</p>
<p>There are many examples of product sales being tied to other products. For example, I cannot buy Sony PSP games for my Nintendo DS. I cannot buy Wii Store titles on Xbox Live. I cannot get genuine Toyota parts for my Honda, etc. Each of these programs require some sort of membership, fees, and certification if you want to participate. </p>
<p>One might argue that &#8220;well these things are nothing like an iPhone&#8221; so here&#8217;s another example. Prior to the release of the iPhone, Apple began selling games for the original iPod. These games were made by 3rd parties, and sold exclusively through iTunes through a non-publicized, apparently private, developer program. Where&#8217;s the gnashing of teeth? I want to see some teeth-gnashing!</p>
<p>What? Nobody cares? Why is that? It&#8217;s because the typical iPhone customer opens the App Store and says &#8220;Super Monkey Ball! Sweet!&#8221; and feels warm and tingly as she get out her credit card. The relative &#8220;openness&#8221; of a platform is not very important to customers. Customers care about a lot of things like quality, price versus value, prestige, neat-o-factor, and so on. Openness is not a marketable issue.</p>
<p>I suspect, as the iPhone platform matures&#8211;remember, it&#8217;s not a year and half old yet&#8211;and Apple wishes to continue expanding their market share, they may be willing to explore more &#8220;openness&#8221;. They may allow applications developed in other environments like Java. They may allow browser plugins like Flash. They may allow competing browsers like Firefox or Opera. But only if they need to, and only if it makes market sense to do so. </p>
<p>Until that time, all 7 or 8 neckbeards who want to distribute apps willy nilly for the iPhone, who don&#8217;t want to use the App Store, and who are too chicken to jailbreak it will just have wait or buy an Android compatible phone (you know, use that free market thing that exists outside of a monopoly).</p>
<p>As a final note, the (ever) Daring Fireball linked to this website, which seeks to document &#8216;dead&#8217; (woe!) apps that Apple has rejected from their App store: <a href="http://boredzo.org/killed-iphone-apps/">http://boredzo.org/killed-iphone-apps/</a></p>
<p>When I last counted there were 11 applications listed. This list is padded by one. If you read through, you&#8217;ll see that &#8220;Box Office&#8221; was taken down and renamed due to a copyright conflict, and is currently available as &#8220;<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284939567&#038;mt=8">Now Playing</a>&#8220;. Hardly a dead, rejected application. </p>
<p>I could make a good case for rejecting all of the other apps myself. Even if there is no good case, Apple announced publicly that they reserve the right to reject applications for whatever reason. Sorry, you&#8217;ll just have to sell that fart joke app for the Blackberry. </p>
<p>The above site links to a blog which <a href="http://fingergaming.com/category/removed-game/">lists</a> a number of games which have been rejected from the app store. My cursory run-through indicates that all of these games were rejected because of copyright issues as well. </p>
<p>I doubt these two web sites are exhaustive in any way. I&#8217;m sure there are more tales of woe to be told. Apple reported some <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/09/09appstore.html">3000</a> apps in the App Store as of September. These two sites list less than 30 apps. We&#8217;re talking about less than 1%. I can live with those numbers.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288799326&#038;mt=8">Newtonica? Sweet!</a>)</p>
