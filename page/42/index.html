				<p>My lovely wife is spending the month of May in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara%2C_Jalisco">Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico</a> working in an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/languages?db=languages&amp;lang=ES&amp;AR=on&amp;ZH=on&amp;TW=on&amp;CS=on&amp;DK=on&amp;NL=on&amp;ET=on&amp;FI=on&amp;FR=on&amp;DE=on&amp;EL=on&amp;HU=on&amp;IS=on&amp;ID=on&amp;IT=on&amp;JA=on&amp;KO=on&amp;LV=on&amp;LT=on&amp;NO=on&amp;PL=on&amp;BR=on&amp;PT=on&amp;RO=on&amp;RU=on&amp;SK=on&amp;SL=on&amp;ES=on&amp;SV=on&amp;TR=on&amp;continue=y&amp;q=albergue">albergue</a> which serves a local hospital.</p>
<p>An albergue is sort of an inn or hostel, and in this particular case it houses people who have traveled across Mexico to seek medical attention in Guadalajara. They charge a very small fee for housing, meals, shower, and laundry facilities. In addition they provide some medicine and care. Many of the workers there help by simply being social with their guests. There are many families there waiting for the outcome of an operation or procedure, and providing someone to talk to helps keep spirits alive.</p>
<p><img class="top alignright" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/05/plaza_centro.JPG" alt="Plaza in the center of Guadalajara" width="274" height="206" /></p>
<p>I slipped down to Guadalajara for a few days to visit and see the sites. Caroline took me on a quick tour of the albergue and the hospital it serves, then we headed into the center of town (Centro) and looked in shops and bought strange grapefruit sodas and felt deliciously foreign. I think we saw <em>maybe</em> four Americans on the trip. (Which is fine. I see those jerks all the time.)</p>
<p>Guadalajara is a big, bustling, noisy, dirty city. The buses are crammed full of people. The traffic is terrible. There is intense wealth and poverty coexisting on the same city block. I loved it.</p>
<p class="clear"><img class="top alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/05/art.JPG" alt="Public Art in the Centro" width="200" height="150" />There is a lot of public art scattered around the city. Even in the (very American) shopping mall we spent an afternoon in (surreal) had lots of sculpture in between the department stores and on the stairs.</p>
<p class="clear"><img class="top alignright" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/05/casa_fuerta.JPG" alt="Casa Fuerta" width="200" height="150" />In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlaquepaque%2C_Jalisco">Tlaquepaque</a> <a href="http://www.spanish-mexico.com/tlaquepaque/">neighborhood</a> (a small town that got engulfed by ever-growing Guadalajara, now an arts district) we saw loads of art; local, regional, and international; and piles of leather work and perhaps the most beautiful <a href="http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/mexico/guadalajara/review-176374.html">restaurant</a> I&#8217;ve ever <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edfladung/32483681/in/photostream/">seen</a>.</p>
<p><img class="push-0 alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/05/caro_at_casa_fuerte.JPG" alt="Caroline at Casa Feurte" width="99" height="133" /></p>
<p>We took one day trip out to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila%2C_Jalisco">Tequila</a> to visit the <a href="http://www.tequilacofradia.com/">Cofradia Tequila factory</a>. As you approach Tequila, the first sign of the town are the fields of blue agave (from which tequila is made). When I say &#8220;blue&#8221; I mean &#8220;wow that plant is really blue&#8221;. It&#8217;s the strangest thing to see these spiny blue plants against the brown landscape. It looks like the earth bristled up a blue, spiky protest against the sky, and then years later people learned you could get drunk off it.<img class="push-0 alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/05/queso_fundido.JPG" alt="Queso Fundido" width="99" height="133" /></p>
<p><img class="top alignright" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/05/tequila_fermenting.JPG" alt="18,000 Liter vats for fermenting tequila" width="250" height="187" />I returned home mid-week to dull, grey, cold Portland weather deeply regretting that I didn&#8217;t stay longer.</p>
<p>(And yes, our Economic Stimulus checks were cashed and promptly exchanged for pesos and spent on bus fare, taxis, food, gifts, tequila, and tequila)</p>

				<p><img src='../../wp-content/uploads/2008/02/selection.jpg' alt='Interesting Selection' class="top" /> This is an interesting set of recommendations on my iTunes receipt.</p>
<p>Perhaps I haven&#8217;t been giving Ms. Lavigne enough credit. I mean to show up along side Sam Harris, Terry Gross, and Richard Dawkinsâ€¦I mean. Wow Alrightâ€¦I admit it. I purchased <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=W4kR8OQCrlQ">Candyman</a>. It&#8217;s awesome. It has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campari">Campari girl</a>!</p>
<p>I just purchased Christopher Hitchens&#8217; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_not_great">God is not Great</a> and while there are no broad-shouldered singing soldiers or sexy girls in pencil skirts, it&#8217;s a fantastic book to hear read aloud (by the author).</p>
<p>It makes one feel all smug* and warm in a wooly academic sweater while listening to some erudite Brit Ex-pat on the radio.</p>
<p>The narrative is a striking balance of personal history wrapped in anecdotal history. Or perhaps it&#8217;s the other way around, in reverse. The book reads, not so much like an argument, but an extended description of one (very smart) man&#8217;s thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s challenging subject matter, no matter your personal philosophy and give one much to think about.</p>

<p>Frozen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnocchi">Gnocchi</a> &#8211; waiting for action (in a pot of boiling water and perhaps some pesto)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a couple of batches of potato gnocchi this weekend. The first batch, made for a dinner party (it was a big hit) and I realized that gnocchi is a.) Easy to make b.) Deeelicious.</p>
<p>I made a second batch just so I could have some later. Uncooked Gnocchi freezes well, and can be popped into some boiling water for a quick meal at the drop of a hat.</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 lbs of cooked, peeled, potatoes (about 8 medium-ish)</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups of flour</li>
<li>2 tbsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li>A large pot (for boiling potatoes)</li>
<li>A large bowl (for mixing in)</li>
<li>A wooden spoon (for mixing with)</li>
<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_mill">food mill</a> (or a grater)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to</h2>
<p>To make potato gnocchi, you will basically make a simple dough from potatoes and flour, rolled out into a snake, and cut into little little tasty dumplings.</p>
<p>Start by rinsing off your potatoes, and tossing them into a pot with a tablespoon of salt and enough cold water to cover. Potatoes are done when you can easily push a knife through the center. This should take about 20 minutes, but keep an eye on them.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/02/taters1.jpg" alt="Cooking Taters" /></p>
<p>When boiling potatoes, always start with cold water. If you try to save time by using hot water from the tap, you&#8217;ll end up with mushy, overcooked potatoes. (The hot water starts cooking the outside of the potato before the inside begins to cook at all).</p>
<p>If you want to cook (and eat) your gnocchi right you&#8217;ll want to have a large pot of generously salted water ready to put on the boil once the potatoes are finished. By the time you&#8217;ve made your first batch of dumplings you can cook them immediately.</p>
<p>Once the potatoes are done, drain and rinse them with cold water and then peel.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/02/best-way-to-peel-a-hot-potato1.jpg" alt="Peeling a potato with a towel" /></p>
<p>It is much easier to peel a hot potato by using a dish towel. Place a potato in the towel and gently rub it. The peel will slide right off.</p>
<p>To create the dough, you will need to grate the potato into small pieces. A food mill does a great job of this (it&#8217;s my favorite new toy that doesn&#8217;t have batteries)</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/02/food-mill1.jpg" alt="Food Mill" /></p>
<p>The model I purchased has neat little feet which fit it on the top of a bowl or pot so you can mill your food into someplace useful instead the floor.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/02/food-mill-in-action1.jpg" alt="Food Mill in action" /></p>
<p>Turn the crank, and the potatoes are reduced to a rice-like pile of pre-dough.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> use a grater to break down your potatoes, or <em>gently</em> use a potato masher to break the potatoes down into smaller bits. Don&#8217;t mash to much. Don&#8217;t use a blender (or you&#8217;ll have paste).</p>
<p>Ideally, you&#8217;ve grated your potatoes into large bowl so now you can add about a cup and a half flour. Using a large (preferably) wooden spoon, gently mix the flour and potato together until it all comes together into sort of a ball. If it seems too loose, add a little more flour.</p>
<p>Flour a work space, turn the dough out, and then knead the dough, adding flour as needed, for about 5 minutes, or until the dough makes a nice soft ball (not to firm, not sticky). Cut the dough into fourths, and cut each fourth in half to create 8 pieces.</p>
<p>Using your preschool clay skills, roll out each piece into a snake (about 3/4 of an inch), and cut it into pieces, about an inch wide each.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/02/little-pillows1.jpg" alt="Pillows of pasta" /></p>
<p>If you are hungry now, and you set your salted water to boil already, toss the gnocchi from each snake into the water. The gnocchi are cooked once they float to the surface of the water.</p>
<p>This will give you just enough time to roll out your next snake.</p>
<p>Use a slotted spoon to lift the gnocchi out of the water, and place in a bowl and cover with a lid or towel to keep warm (you may want to warm your bowl in the oven to help keep the gnocchi warm).</p>
<p>Dress your gnocchi in a little olive oil, lemon juice, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper (or some ugly pre-made red sauce from a jar).</p>
<p>If you want to stash gnocchi away for a pasta emergency, as you cut up the gnocchi, arrange them onto cookie sheets so they are close, but not touching (otherwise they&#8217;ll all stick together and you&#8217;ll have one giant mono-gnocchi). Place the cookie sheets in the freezer for about 2 or 3 hours.</p>
<p>After the gnocchi are frozen, pop them off the cookie sheet, double-bag and place them back in the freezer for up to a month.</p>

				<p>Recent news followed by my pithy remarks.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a> Announced Without Pony. Bloggers Demand Pony.</h2>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/january#wed-16-boutin">The (ever) Daring Fireball</a> and <a href="http://slate.com/id/2182227/">Paul Boutin at Slate</a> are lamenting the fact that the newly announced Mac sub-notebook doesn&#8217;t have some manner of cellular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution-Data_Optimized">EVDO</a> type of use-anywhere-networking-just-like-the-iPhone support. A quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like me, Boutin was hoping for ubiquitous wireless networking. The more I think about this, the more certain I am that itâ€™s just silly that my phone always has a network and (as of yesterday) knows where it is, but my Mac doesnâ€™t.</p></blockquote>
<p>While, yes, it may in fact be technically feasible to incorporate a cellular card into a skinny little laptop and offer the same clever network switch-a-roo technology that is in the iPhone, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good or profitable idea.</p>
<p>To rebut this point: It&#8217;s a laptop, not a phone! Do you need your TV to geo-locate? How about your printer? Maybe your microwave?</p>
<p>To rebut in a slightly more classy fashion, Consider the two following use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are in a new or unfamiliar location, perhaps walking or driving. Perhaps you&#8217;ve missed a turn out in the &#8216;burbs. You realize &#8220;oh foo, I don&#8217;t know where I am any more.&#8221; You need directions.</li>
<li>You suddenly realize you&#8217;re in a strange coffee shop, using your laptop, and realize &#8220;oh foo, I don&#8217;t know where I am&#8221;. You need directions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m going to wager that case 1 is the most common. I can remember at least a few times I&#8217;ve been in just that predicament. This is why the iPhone has a Google Maps application with a location feature.</p>
<p>If case number 2 is happening to you often enough to consider a laptop upgrade, perhaps you need to switch to decaf.</p>
<p>Paul Boutin, in his article, posits the scenario where he&#8217;s riding shotgun in a car, and wants to help the driver with directions, so he <em>wants to dig around in his bag and boot up his laptop instead of picking up a cellphone and calling for directions.</em> This strikes me as an edge case.</p>
<p>I think that is what Apple thinks too. Yeah, they could do it. But why?</p>
<p>There are hard-core super road warriors who need connectivity everywhere. But these guys are (a) a small market and (b) are purchasing &#8220;pro&#8221; versions of laptops and plugging in whatever wireless provider&#8217;s card they need.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a laundry list of other reasons why this is a dumb idea for this particular computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who will the provider be, Sprint? ATT? Should Apple standardize on one provider, or provide generic hardware? If so, who supports what? Can Apple guarantee that fickle telecommunications companies won&#8217;t pull the plug on hardware support in a year?</li>
<li>What hardware standard do you support? Do you hope for 3G? Do you use Edge? Do you put a giant chunky card-slot on your sleek, whisper thin computer that only 1 out of a 100 owners will use?</li>
<li>See above, the target customer for this computer doesn&#8217;t want this.</li>
<li>Data connections over cellular networks suck, yes even 3G is only as good as a good dial-up connection.</li>
<li>The MacBook Air sports 5 hours of battery life. How&#8217;d you like to make that <em>3</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>I see three big markets for the MacBook Air, in descending order:</p>
<ol>
<li>People with one beefy machine at home or in the office who want a second, small computer for traveling, giving presentations, or otherwise using on the go</li>
<li>Students. This laptop will fit in your <a href="http://www.trapperkeeper.com/">TrapperKeeper</a> along side all 18 of your chemistry books. (When I mentioned the Air to my wife she remarked &#8220;oh, what I wanted a year ago.&#8221;)</li>
<li>People who don&#8217;t need or want a beefy computer, and want something small and light that looks nice and isn&#8217;t complicated (Hi Paris!).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hosting Provider Makes Point. Point Missed.</h2>
<p>It started here:<br />
<a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/01/07/how-ruby-on-rails-could-be-much-better/">http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/01/07/how-ruby-on-rails-could-be-much-better/</a></p>
<p>And went here:<br />
<a href="http://www.al3x.net/2008/01/shared-hosting-is-ghetto.html">http://www.al3x.net/2008/01/shared-hosting-is-ghetto.html</a></p>
<p>Link number one &#8211; the author, a tech at Dreamhost (where I host my web sites), writes a constructive article detailing the difficulties they encountered in trying to support the Ruby On Rails framework. Also, he articulates his opinion that if the Rails community could standardize their hosting and deployment practices &#8211; or at least provide a set of best practices that can be easily repeated &#8211; and make it easy to deploy in shared hosting environments, it would really benefit Rails developers (to provide cheap hosting environments for learning and development) and help promote Rails as a technology.</p>
<p>These are true statements, with which I agree completely. (They are also born out by tales of woe I&#8217;ve heard myself from folks who tried to manage their own Rails environment, on their own servers.)</p>
<p>Link number two: Rails dude gets snippy and calls shared hosting a ghetto (in reference to an <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html" title="Long, Technical, Ranty">article</a> by an ex-Rails developer) and misses the point entirely. This second article makes points about how Java and Python have stayed away from shared hosting (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;rls=en&#038;q=java+hosting&#038;btnG=Search">not</a> entirely <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&#038;q=shared+Python+hosting&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8 ">true</a>). He then proceeds to discuss his preference for the &#8220;nightmare&#8221; of setting up his own server versus the nightmare setting up a shared server (pick your poison, I suppose). </p>
<p>He concludes by incorrectly identifying a popular hosted PHP application as a Rails app and trying to argue that shared hosting wouldn&#8217;t make him any money. Oh. Well then. Point made, I guess.</p>
<p>Dallas Kashuba at the Dreamhost blog is correct. Rails is very troublesome to host and deploy. This problem &#8211; regardless of whether the hosting is in the shared hosting ghetto or in your personal server farm &#8211; is still a problem and a deal-breaker for a lot of people. It certainly was for me. Getting all snippy doesn&#8217;t change that fact.</p>
<p>The Michael Barrett Professional Opinionâ„¢ is that Ruby on Rails is all sizzle and no steak. The development problems it solves are only solved if you&#8217;re starting with a fresh, clean, empty database; have no legacy systems or data to integrate to, and have lots of time to babysit a server. </p>
<p>Call me when RoR reaches version 3, 4, or 5. Maybe we&#8217;ll try again.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t make new year&#8217;s resolutions, but I do want to be a better blogger-ator this year.</p>
<p><img src='../../wp-content/uploads/2008/01/moleskine-715525.jpg' alt='Moleskine' class="top" />I&#8217;d like to get back up to my &#8216;early days&#8217; level of output, so I&#8217;m going to schedule myself a little blog time on a regular type basis. A week or three ago I saw a blurb fly by my RSS feed at work, maybe it was <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">here</a>, maybe it was <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">here</a>, I don&#8217;t remember. The gist of the article was to go ahead and schedule a meeting for yourself once a day to spend a little quality time alone with your notebook. Because hey, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936//">every day, once a day, give yourself a present. Don&#8217;t plan it, don&#8217;t wait for it, just&#8230; let it happen. Could be a new shirt at the men&#8217;s store, a catnap in your office chair, or&#8230; two cups of good, hot, black coffee</a> (with plenty of cream and sugar).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set a recurring meeting every day (at work) for 11 am. I&#8217;ve managed to actually go for a coffee and scribble some thoughts down exactly once in two weeks. That is one more time than I probably would have done so otherwise, so I&#8217;m declaring victory.</p>
<p>I have a couple of recipes floating around for <a href="http://www.blueplatebachelor.com/">BluePlate</a> which I haven&#8217;t added yet, and I&#8217;ve been meaning to show off a couple of things I&#8217;ve learned about the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend PHP framework</a> (which has taken 75% of the suck out of PHP development). All of these things (and moreâ„¢) are languishing in the back of my head, never to be seen.</p>
<p>So I think Wednesdays are the new blog days. Things are quiet at home in the evening &#8211; I can get home from the office, mix up a martini, and scribble out some words. It&#8217;s a perfect plan.</p>

						<div class="entry total-105 col3bg ">
				<p>I&#8217;ve created my own WordPress Theme (coinciding nicely with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/12/wordpress-232/">2.3.2</a> upgrade).</p>
<p>When I kissed <a href="../../2007/09/09/software-updates/index.html">RapidWeaver goodbye</a>, and re-familiarized myself with WordPress, I didn&#8217;t want to spend time customizing a web site design&#8230;I just wanted to fix the problem of me not posting very often. I discovered the <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/the-ideal-website">Ideal Website</a> theme &#8211; which is pretty nice <em>looking</em> but the HTML which is ultimately generated is pretty much tag-soup (nee Crap). Also, oddly, the website advertising the theme boasts all this &#8220;openness&#8221;&#8230;but the license that ships with the theme is fairly restrictive&#8230;silly, dubiously legal, software boilerplate legalese which only sort of applies (How much can you really copyright an open source template API and standard HTML implementation if you&#8217;re just giving it away?). Needless to say, I don&#8217;t want to be encumbered by that noise. I might want to change the typeface or something. </p>
<p>So, with the holidays in full pause, I had time to rework things. I&#8217;m reusing a very old background image from one of this site&#8217;s previous incarnations along with my <em>classic</em> logo. I did steal one idea from the Ideal theme&#8230;the contact form at the bottom of the page. That&#8217;s a clever idea really. Why should that be a separate page? As I continue to tweak things, I may make that collapsible so it&#8217;s only visible when needed&#8230;but I like not sending a visitor off to another page to ask me something.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking advantage of the nifty <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS framework</a> to simplify my layout needs. The framework is really quite nice, I&#8217;ve been using at work for quite a while now. It greatly simplifies your page layout work, and also makes it simple for me to do more &#8216;designed&#8217; blog posts by taking advantage of the framework&#8217;s existing CSS class names.</p>
<p>The layout is based on a simple vertical grid, with classical proportions: 8x5x3. The center column (5) appears as whitespace wherever more focus is desired (viewing a single post or page, for example). Type is set on an 18 pixel <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb/">baseline grid</a> which gives everything a nice rhythm and makes it easier to read.</p>
<p>As I continue to tweak this, I&#8217;d like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate some bolder color in an effective fashion</li>
<li>Gracefully hide or show elements on the page as they are needed via JavaScript</li>
<li>Add a comments policy and a contact policy (just in case)</li>
<li>Finally get some portfolio on line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <a href="../../2007/12/29/flickr-phobia/index.html">flickr</a> question</strong></p>
<p>Flickr sucks. I spent a few hours playing with itâ€¦It&#8217;s slow. The tools don&#8217;t work very well (e.g. odd, useless error messages with raw xml strings. <em>Great. Thanks.</em>). I decided that if I want to share photos with people I&#8217;ll use Google&#8217;s picassa, and otherwise I&#8217;ll just post any worthwhile pictures in the blog.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been procrastinating updating my site for a while: noodling with layout ideas; thinking about whether I should rework abouthalf.com to be simply a portfolio site (since most of my blogging takes place on <a href="http://www.blueplatebachelor.com/">Blueplate Bachelor</a> nowadays anyway) or setting up a sub-domain for my professional activities; and how to handle putting up snapshots and portfolio pages.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr&#8217;s</a> service is the most obvious, whitest, elephant in the room &#8211; just sitting there, begging for e-peanuts (enuts?), hoping to serve my pics up to the disinterested masses. Obviously <em>lots</em> of people use flickr and sing its web 2.0 praises. I have a number of flickr feeds bookmarked for regular perusal. There&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bar-art/">great stuff</a> there. But I&#8217;m still gun-shy about using it for my own site.</p>
<p>Here are my pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>
<ol>
<li>Flickr provides an easy recovery or backup if I lose my images or all my hard drives suddenly go belly up.</li>
<li>I could share photos in and out of the context of my site (e.g. more options for reaching an audience)</li>
<li>All the cool kids are doing it.</li>
<li>Flickr provides many methods to upload photos (email, phone, traditional upload) which means I could easily pop a pic online for somebody pretty much anyplace, anywhere, anytime.</li>
<li>There are many tools, plugins, apis, etc which allow Flickr content to be integrated into your web site.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>
<ol>
<li>flickr.com is blocked by many corporate firewalls (at least mine). If I&#8217;m using my site for self promotion, that can become a roadblock.</li>
<li>Flickr&#8217;s search features make it very easy for some lazy, dishonest art director to steal your pictures and use them without attribution. (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;client=safari&#038;rls=en&#038;q=flickr+photos+stolen&#038;btnG=Search">no. really.</a>)</li>
<li>What happens when Yahoo (flickr&#8217;s owners) decide to become evil? Do they own all your pictures? Do they claim copyright? Do they start selling your pics back to you?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly the only solution is to noodle around with the service and see if I like it or not, and see if the wacky fun webbiness outweighs my concerns. Film at eleben.</p>

				<p>This is a handy little item:<br />
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537628.aspx" title="Mark of the web">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537628.aspxÂ </a></p>
<p>The &#8220;Mark of the web&#8221; is a specially formatted html comment which resides at the top of an HTML document, just below the DOCTYPE declaration.</p>
<p>It might look like this:Â </p>
<p><codey>&lt;!&#8211; saved from url=(0023)http://www.contoso.com/ &#8211;&gt;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Mark of <del>Zorro</del> the web&#8221; tells Internet Explorer 7 (and IE 6 under XP SP2) that the web page you&#8217;re looking at is from the internet (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=I'm+from+the+government+and+I'm+here+to+help&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="highly quotable">and it&#8217;s here to help!</a>) and it should use internet-appropriate security settings.</p>
<p>Typically this Â mark is applied by IE when you save an HTML document from a web site to your local hard drive.</p>
<p>However, you can take advantage of this mark for your own needs, by adding a generic mark like the following (beneath the DOCTYPE, and before the opening HTML tag):</p>
<p><code>&lt;!-- saved from url=(0014)about:internet --&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now why might you want to do this?</p>
<p>Newer versions of Internet Explorer on Windows have a &#8220;heightened&#8221; security model which prevents local HTML files from doing anything &#8220;active&#8221; like run a JavaScript (or VBScript) or run content powered by an ActiveX plugin (like Flash or Quicktime).Â </p>
<p>If you have ever tried to test some JavaScript in IE running from a web page saved to your desktop, you have seen the infamous &#8220;information bar&#8221; which helpfully tells you that &#8220;active content&#8221; has been blocked, but you can allow it here, by clicking this button, turning this crank, supplying the password, and defeating the ogre at the end of level three.</p>
<p>Of course if your test page links to <em>second</em>Â local pageâ€¦you have to go through the information bar a <em>second</em> time.</p>
<p>Â The mark of the web allows a local HTML document to pretend like it has been loaded from the internet security zone, and will then allow you to run JavaScripts, Flash, Applets, and the like.</p>
<p>If you publish HTML documents which need to be read from a CD, from your hard drive (like help files, a catalog, or documentation) this will come in handy.</p>
<p>The Mark of the WebÂ <em><strong>will not</strong></em>Â let you access a second page via an AJAX type request* &#8211; so while it&#8217;s helpful, it&#8217;s not a cure-all.</p>
<p>I discovered this little tidbit at work when I was trying to put together some HTML software prototypes that could be run on an analyst&#8217;s laptop (without having to run IIS or some such silliness).Â </p>
<p><small>*In my tests with aÂ <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/api/ajax/updater" title="Ajax.Updater documentation">Prototype Ajax.Updater</a>Â object the request failed silently. Iframes should work ok, provided the document loaded in the iframe has the MOTW too, but I haven&#8217;t tested it.</small></codey></p>
