<p>That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Activation was a snap&#8230;super easy. It took maybe 10 minutes. Most of that was waiting for the progress bar.</p>
<p>Syncing the first time took a little longer than I expected&#8230;but it has to basically look through your mac and find email accounts, and photos, calendars, and whatnot in order to give you the option of synching them up.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve just noodled with it while I wait for my cell number to transfer over.</p>
<p>I sat at my dining table, surfing the internet, and decided to checkout my bank&#8217;s online software. I read they had a &#8216;mobile&#8217; version of the site. Sure enough I loaded up a nice, small version of my online banking software with the 4 most  used functions (account balance, transfers, bill pay, and office locations).</p>
<p>I came to the realization that I could be in a restaurant, decide that I didn&#8217;t want to put dinner on my credit card&#8230;whip out the phone and move some money around, and pay with my debit card. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those things that is so obvious that you wonder why we haven&#8217;t had this for years already. Maybe corporate power users with their Treos or whatever are accustomed to this, but I was kinda blown away.</p>

<p>Instead of following some boring old wedding gift registry, <a href="http://www.blueplatebachelor.com/author/julie/">Julie</a>, her special man, and <a href="http://www.blueplatebachelor.com/author/kathleen/">Kathleen</a> bought us a wine dinner kit from the <a href="https://www.toriimorwinery.com/">Torii Mor</a> winery here in Oregon.</p>
<p>The kit included three bottles of wine, a 2005 Pinot Blanc, a 2005 Pinot Noir, and a 2005 GewÃ¼rztraminer. Also included was menu, recipe cards, instructions for preparing, a grocery list, and even little menu cards if you wanted to be all fancy.</p>
<p>The menu featured crab cakes with a salad, braised lamb shanks with polenta and broccoli, a pound cake covered in berries (soaked in the GewÃ¼rztraminer).</p>
<p>I <em>loved</em> the idea, and fair&#8217;s fair so the Blue Plate Misses and I had the three over for dinner and I prepared the meal.</p>
<p>Of course I deviated from the menu. Because that&#8217;s how I roll. Yo.</p>
<p>I braised two whole chickens in cheap red wine with vegetables, and altered the recipe for the polenta a bit.</p>
<p>The Blue Plate Misses is the best cake baker a man could hope to marry, so when the recipe called for a store bought pound cake we scoffed and substituted my darling wife&#8217;s pound cake instead.</p>
<p>However, I did follow the crab cake recipe to a &#8220;T&#8221; because I had never made them before. Well maybe followed to a lowercase &#8220;t&#8221;. The recipe called for 12 oz of crab meat, I used a full pound. The recipe called for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panko">panko</a> bread crumbs, I used the plain old western variety, but less.</p>
<p>The crab cakes were served over a simple salad dressed with a simple citrus and mustard salad dressing &#8212; which was a nice combo. The lemon complemented the crab nicely.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the dinner was  a huge success, we drank all the wine and proceeded to sip espresso and talk until the cows came home. damn cows.</p>
<p>Here is the slightly altered recipe for crab cakes:</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 Tbsp. Mayonnaise</li>
<li>2 large egg yolks</li>
<li>1 1/2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. finely grated lemon zest</li>
<li>1/4 cup minced green onion</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. fresh, minced dill</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. fresh, minced cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
<li>16oz crab meat</li>
<li>1 to 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs</li>
<li>Unsalted butter and olive oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Start by mincing up your herbs and green onion, set these aside in a little bowl. Get your butter out of the fridge and let it soften. Open your crab meat (can, pouch, crate, or whatever it came in) and dump into a bowl. Have another bowl standing by, then using your hands, go through all of the crab, breaking up the large pieces and feeling for bits of shell. Discard any shell you find and place the &#8216;processed&#8217; crab into the second bowl.</p>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the mayo, egg yolks, lemon juice, and mustard. Then stir in the onion, salt, pepper, and herbs.</p>
<p>Gently stir in the crab meat and about 3/4 cup of bread crumbs. Let this stand for about 10 minutes or so. This will let moisture soak into the bread crumbs. The mixture should hold together when gently pressed, but it should still feel moist.</p>
<p>Form the mixture into cakes by gently pressing a small handful into a 1/3 cup measuring cup (or something similarly sizedâ€¦about an inch deep and 2 inches in diameter). Tap the measuring cup in your hand to release the cake. This should make about 10 or 12 cakes Place all cakes onto a plate and chill for about an hour before frying.  Chilling helps the crab cakes set up and bind together so they don&#8217;t fall apart in the frying pan. Icky.</p>
<p>Heat a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat. Add a tablespoon or two of butter. The pan should be hot enough that the butter foams as it melts. When the foaming has stopped (there will still be bubbles in the â€¦just no new bubbles are forming) then all the water has evaporated from the butter and you are left with buttery goodness ready for frying. Add a small amount of olive oil to the pan.</p>
<p>Gently place a batch of cakes into the hot pan and fry until golden brown on each side (a couple of minutes).<br />
Move the finished cakes to a clean plate and serve immediately, or keep warm in an oven at 200ÂºF or so.</p>

<p>Right after the wedding the BluePlate Misses and I went to lovely <a href="http://www.rockawaybeach.net/">Rockaway Beach, Oregon</a> for a short mini-moon (we&#8217;ll be flying off to sunny Mexico for the real thing this December).</p>
<p>We rented your classic cheesy beach house, with classic cheesy shell-encrusted furnishings and decor. However this beach house had a little something extra. In the kitchen, along with recipe clippings and random menus from long defunct restaurants was this lovely little book about cocktails.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ABC of Cocktails&#8221; is authored anonymously, but the 1953 edition credits the art and calligraphy to a Ruth McCrea. The dust jacket also features the 1953 price, $1.00.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a short, little book &#8211; only about 60 pages, but in it is every cocktail recipe you might ever consider to be a classic.</p>
<p>The forward includes this lovely little passage that is at once steadfastly earnest and honest about the joys of alcohol consumption:</p>
<blockquote><p>
But cocktails needn&#8217;t be confusing, if this basic truth about all cocktails is made clear at once: they serve three entirely different social or human purposes, and should be chosen and prepared accordingly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>First:</dt>
<dd>Coctails provide a graceful and pleasant way to drink for people who enjoy or need the relaxation or the stimulation of a alcohol &#8212; they are gin whiskey, brandy, or rum pleasantly colored, flavored, and served in a pretty glass.</dd>
<dt>Second:</dt>
<dd>Cocktails are excellent stimulators of appetite when they are not sweet, and so provide a perfect before-dinner course which awakens the palate while it relaxes the nerves.</dd>
<dt>Third:</dt>
<dd>Cocktails afford the seldom-drinker a pleasantly flavored small quantity of alclohol to serve or drink for social purposes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously, if you are making cocktails for vigorous drinkers, you will make them long on liquor and short on flavoring and sweetening; if you are making them before dinner you will make them short on sugar or sweet flavorings; and if you are making them for amateurs, maiden aunts, and such, you will make them short on liquor and strong on flavoring and sugar.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I especially love these quips: &#8220;for vigorous drinkers&#8221; and &#8220;for amateurs, maiden aunts, and such&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t have phrased that better with week to work on it, a full staff, and an intern. (where&#8217;s my coffee?)</p>
<p>I have more than a couple of cocktail books that I&#8217;ve purchased or I&#8217;ve been given as gifts. Other than a couple of quick experiments, these books sit unused on the shelf, or are used to decorate the bar. They don&#8217;t get <em>used</em> because the recipes are all so darn complicated and require 18 ingredients a piece.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty annoying to go out and buy some odd, special ingredient for a cocktail, make the drink, discover it tastes sickly sweet, and then be left with a giant bottle of some syrupy old lady booze that never ever gets used. (I have  a bottle of Anisette for anyone who&#8217;s interested).</p>
<p>Contemporary cocktail books also have this annoying habit of either being overly gourmet and snooty, or they take on some silly air of rebelliousness or hipsterism (because drinking is <em><a href="http://grouper.com/c/Funny/Kids_In_The_Hall_Girl_Drink_Drunk_/1051481">bad</a></em>).</p>
<p>&#8220;The ABC of Cocktails&#8221; is none of that. Short, sweet (but not too sweet) and too the point. And with real recipes I really use.</p>
<p>I very nearly stole this book from the beach house. I really wanted to. What a great souvenir! But I decided I&#8217;d be depriving someone else of the knowledge it contained, so I let it stay.</p>
<p>Instead I wrote down all the publisher information I could find, and then googled it up. One e-purchase later I have my own copy of the 1953 edition. If you can find your own hiding in a dusty attic or in a used bookstore or on the internet, I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>I think the best thing you can do for yourself on your birthday is to simply take the day off.</p>
<p>Off from work, off from the cellphone. <em><strong>Off</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I started the day by making breakfast and lunch (to go) for my sugar-baby (a.k.a Mrs. TheBachelor) and having an extra cup of coffee. Following a leisurely shower, I went to a local coffee shop, had a lattÃ© and read a few chapters in my book.</p>
<p>On the way home I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.dwell.com/">Dwell</a> and a stoagie from my local <a href="http://www.richscigar.com">Rich&#8217;s</a>, a bottle of Gordon&#8217;s from the OLC, and a nice steak from my local market.</p>
<p>The steak made a fine lunch. I use the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_99,00.html?rsrc=search">Alton Brown searing method for steaks</a>. If you haven&#8217;t tried itâ€¦put a thin pat of butter on top of your steak right before you serve it. It&#8217;s fantastic (you will also experience a sort of harmony knowing the meat and condiment come from the same animal).</p>
<p>This afternoon will entail reading of said magazine and smoking of said cigar on the porch. This may, or may not, include a martini or three.</p>
<p>This may be followed by a visit from Mrs. TheBachelor and a nice hot bath.</p>
<p>All this self-indulgence is going to run me about $35 (including the gin and cigar). This is pretty inexpensive if you&#8217;re a grown-up-type person with a job. Saying home from work, and not doing anything is a wonderful treat. There&#8217;s no pressure to be anywhere or to &#8220;make the most&#8221; of anything. You can relax and enjoy the lifestyle that you miss because you&#8217;re too busy working to pay for it.</p>

<p>So I made the switch-a-roo and dumped MS Office of my system (safely archived on the original install CDs).</p>
<p>Above you see a sliver of the Terminal, Activity Monitor (&#8216;cuz it&#8217;s neat), Coda, Numbers, Pages, and NeoOffice.</p>
<p>NeoOffice is there to do &#8220;heavy lifting&#8221; in case I run across some Office-y type function I can handle with Numbers or Pages. You know serious things like printing one mailing label in the middle of a sheet. You know. <em>Hard core</em> functionality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also moved Abouthalf to WordPress.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> on <a href="http://www.blueplatebachelor.com/">BluePlate Bachelor</a> for quite a while and I finally decided to make the switch.</p>
<p>WordPress has two big pluses over <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/">RapidWeaver</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s not platform specific</li>
<li>It imports <em>and</em> exports a variety of formats.</li>
<li>One can edit a theme <em>inline and on-the-fly</em></li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t bug me to upgrade every time I launch it
</li>
</ol>
<p>Four. Four big pluses.</p>
<p>I am using the nifty <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/the-ideal-website">&#8220;Ideal Website Theme&#8221;</a> from <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/the-ideal-website">InformationArchitects.jp</a>.</p>
<p>I like the clean simplicity of the design, I like the placement of archives as links at the bottom and other features. I figure this was a nice palette cleanser while I figure out how I want Abouthalf to work in the future.</p>
<p>WordPress is a nice product for an end-user to work with. As a developer, I look at some of the plug-in code and shudder. WordPress is a very typical PHP application, and all that that implies. This is not relevant though. The blogging/writing interface is nice and clean, and I can export my data, or dig it out of my database however I want, meaning I can change my little mind any time I want.</p>
<p>Speaking of horrible PHP code, I&#8217;ve been working with the <a href="http://framework.zend.org/">Zend Framework</a> over the past few days, writing a &#8216;back office&#8217; for a shopping cart.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very nice. No really. It de-crappifies a lot of the problems with PHP application writing. The framework is PHP 5 only, which some my deride, I applaud. </p>
<p>The framework has a lot of the features that you mind find in Cake or Ruby On Rails. A Object-Relational-Data  system, a controller object with view objects, a &#8220;Front Controller&#8221; class if you want to implement a full application.</p>
<p>I tried noodling around with CakePHP a few times. Went through the docs, tried the blog tutorial, tried it again. I always found it very counter-intuitive, and counter PHP.</p>
<p>One problem I find with CakePHP is that while it&#8217;s powerful, you can&#8217;t leverage any piece of the framework by itself easily. For example. Say you&#8217;ve got an existing web site&#8230;and you want to add on one simple data entry form. Cake wants you to build a whole app. While you hypothetically <em>could</em> extract its implementation of ActiveRecord, it wouldn&#8217;t be <em>easy</em>.</p>
<p>With Zend Framework you have the option of using only bits of the framework in a decoupled fashion.</p>
<p>So, for example, if your data-entry form only has one view, and one action, and it&#8217;s the only form you&#8217;re making, then you can just use the Zend_Db and Zend_Table classes and be done with it. If it gets slightly more complex, you could &#8211; at any time &#8211; <em>add in</em> a controller object &#8211; and then <em>add in</em> add in a view object when and <em>if</em> you need to. <strong>Nice.</strong></p>
<p>In the past week I&#8217;ve found it to be easy to under stand and work with. The documentation on the individual components is pretty solid&#8230;however you may need to hunt for a good &#8220;putting it all together&#8221; tutorial. I&#8217;ve found two good ones by the same guy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://akrabat.com/zend-framework-tutorial/">http://akrabat.com/zend-framework-tutorial/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://akrabat.com/zend-auth-tutorial/">http://akrabat.com/zend-auth-tutorial/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Coming soon I&#8217;ll detail how I used the Zend_View class in coordination with the Zend_Mail class to send notification emails from within a controller action method.</p>
