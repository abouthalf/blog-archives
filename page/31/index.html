				<p>I’ve been utilizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Uri">data URIs</a> in more and more of my UI work. I use them to insert icons into tool bars, or to add graphical flourishes to elements without having to manage a large number of additional images. These elements are enhancements to otherwise functional designs, so I feel no remorse for IE 7’s inability to display them.</p>
<p><a href="http://bgrounder.abouthalf.com/"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1361 alignleft" title="bGrounder" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/256-144x144.png" alt="bGrounder" width="144" height="144" /></a> To produce the needed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> encoded images, I’ve been relying on a tiny little command line script to encode the image and spit out the results. While this works, it’s not particularly convenient and it’s not something I can easily share with other developers and the graphic designers on my team.</p>
<p>So over the weekend I built <a href="http://bgrounder.abouthalf.com">bGrounder</a>.</p>
<p>bGrounder lets you upload images and convert them into CSS rules and HTML image tags with images embedded directly with data URIs. If you’re using a modern browser that isn’t Internet Explorer, you can click and drag images from your desktop right into the uploader. In all browsers you can add many images via the ‘Add images’ button (HTML5 browsers allow you to select multiple images at once).</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-28-at-7.20.55-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1362" title="bGrounder screen capture" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-28-at-7.20.55-AM-480x392.png" alt="" width="480" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>Process each image individually or do them all at once. The resulting code appears in the text boxes below the uploader. The CSS rules specify the encoded image as a background image, using a class name derived from the file name of the image. The HTML output is a simple IMG tag with width and height set. The IMG tag is probably less useful over all &#8211; generally inline images are part of actual content of the page and you probably don’t want to completely ignore older browsers. But maybe you do. Maybe that’s just <em>how you roll</em>. Additionally if you reuse the same IMG tag with embedded image data, you get no benefit from caching…the browser has no way to know that two embedded images are the same (whereas a single CSS sheet is loaded once).</p>
<p>Share and enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="technicalstuffs">Technical stuffs</h2>
<p>bGrounder gave me a chance to play with the <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/">Silex</a> PHP “micro-framework”. I found it very easy to get up and running with Silex, surprisingly so. I rather liked the simplicity and minimalism of defining function closures which respond to URL patterns and HTTP methods. Very tidy. My main application file was only 50 lines long, including comments and generous whitespace. (this doesn’t include the Silex library itself, or the image processing classes I wrote, but still. Short.)</p>
<p>This also gave me the chance to work with this <a href="http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/">jQuery File Upload</a> widget. This set of jQuery plugins enhances an existing file input to allow for multiple uploads in old browser, creates a rich UI with progress bars, and can even support cross domain uploading. It also ships with a number of server-side implementations to help you get started. Perhaps somewhat ironically, this was more complex than the PHP framework. Once I got my head around how it worked though, it was fairly easy to customize the UI and use my own server-side upload handler.</p>

				<p><a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/03/sleight-retina-reckoning/">Shawn Blanc</a> links to this article by <a href="http://stuntbox.com/blog/2012/03/retina-display-reckoning-for-magazine-publishers/">David Sleight</a> in which David talks about the logistical problems of publishing magazines suitable for the new iPad&#8217;s new Retina Display.</p>
<p>The gist is that Adobe&#8217;s magazine app publishing platform (as well as other&#8217;s) creates a magazine by wrapping up a big stack of PNG image files in a thin interactivity layer. On the new iPad, these images will be too small to be legible. I hinted at this <a href="../../2011/05/21/vanity-fair-for-ipad-review/index.html" title="Vanity Fair for iPad: Review">problem</a> when I reviewed Vanity Fair&#8217;s iPad edition. Today each &#8220;magazine&#8221; is an enormous file (200MB to 400MB) with text that can&#8217;t be enlarged, selected, copied, exported, or read aloud by accessibility software. In order for this publishing format to work on high resolution displays, the images will have to be much higher resolution &#8211; and therefore much larger in file size. Otherwise the text will be blurry and hard to read. If you increase the size of the images making up each page, you increase the overall file size of each magazine. These things are already too big to store. I never keep more than an issue or two on my iPad. And of course, download times will increase as well.</p>
<p>I already find these magazines hard to read. Even my 37 year old web nerd eyes find the text in these magazines (on the original iPad) to be too blurry. Compared to iBooks, the Kindle App, or just any old web page in Safari, they look terrible (at least for reading). I came to the same conclusion that David did; they should have been using web technologies all along.</p>
<p>Vanity Fair has a decent web site already and they obviously have a CMS supporting it. Why not create a tablet optimized version of the site with the same content as the magazine then make that site an add-on to an existing subscription or create a partial pay-wall? That web content could be wrapped in an app and cached for offline use. Most graphics (borders, boxes, shapes, etc) could be delivered as tiny SVGs, photos could be delivered as hi-res JPGs. The end result would be much smaller than what they deliver now, but far more readable. It&#8217;s possible that they might have to sacrifice some fine layout control&#8230;but the result would be reasonably future proof content.</p>
<p>Vanity Fair and Conde Naste have already produced and killed one version of a magazine app. The current one is about to be obsoleted, as is all the content they&#8217;ve already produced for it. Why keep hitching their wagon to Adobe&#8217;s lame last century mentality mule?</p>

				<p>I ran across this <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/03/05/i-use-my-ipad-like-an-ipad-not-like-a-pc/">piece at the Loop</a>. It&#8217;s a good piece, and I completely agree. He&#8217;s (probably deliberately) overlooking a key fact about the people who argue about whether an iPad can replace a PC. The people in the tech press having this debate are not consumers, the&#8217;re paid partisans. Their job is to either generatie traffic by by posting fighty troll bait, encouraging lots of fighty comments in the process, or to attempt to sway consumer opinion. Given that traditional PC sales are declining and that iPad sales have been greater thie year than any single PC manufacturer&#8217;s, you can imagine why they might try to convince the public that they still need a cheap laptop.</p>
<p>Consumers, in general, have never really liked PCs. They like what they can <em>do</em> with PCs. An iPad does most of the things that people do with a PC and it also looks nice, it&#8217;s small, it&#8217;s easy to set up, requires almost no maintenance, it&#8217;s quiet, doesn&#8217;t get hot, it doesn&#8217;t weigh much, and it&#8217;s priced well under a thousand dollars. Except for cheap, tiny laptops (which also sell poorly) a PC is the opposite of all of those things.</p>

				<p><a href="http://wtfqrcodes.com/">WTF QR CODES</a> was posted on Daring Fireball so the entire internet is already bored of it. But I love it. It it speaks to me.</p>
<p>Advertising and marketing with QR codes is absolutely idiotic. QR codes slapped on websites are the worst offenders. I&#8217;m already reading a website, <em>on a computer,</em> and you want me to get out my smart phone, fire up a QR Code app, decode your dumb code, and get what? A link to a website? Really? Why not just link to the web site so I can visit the site on the computer I&#8217;m already using? Dumb.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen advertising with no information other than a QR code. Congratulations! Where you could have had an easy to remember web address or a Facebook page, you now have <a href="http://robotbarf.com/">Robot Barf</a> that no one can read and only the most dedicated neck-beard will take the time to decode. <em>Nice work</em>.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem of &#8220;get this text into my smart phone without me typing&#8221; is either speech recognition software or OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. For example there are iPhone Apps which will read signage and translate the text into another language on the fly. QR Codes were created so machines could quickly scan boxes as they wiz by on a conveyer belt. They weren&#8217;t meant for people&#8230;because people can <em>read</em>.</p>
<p>Some evil genius convinced thousands of marketing weasels that QR Codes were going to be the next big thing, so now they show up where ever there&#8217;s a fool who needs to be parted from some money.</p>

				<p><a href="https://path.com/">Path</a> is a social networking application for iPhone and Android which emphasizes posting and sharing updates with a relatively small social circle. In contrast to Twitter or Facebook, where users may have thousands of friends or followers, Path tries to focus on actual family and friends and tries to keep things more personal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to accomplish this Path was <a href="http://mclov.in/2012/02/08/path-uploads-your-entire-address-book-to-their-servers.html">uploading your entire address book from your phone to their servers</a> without your explicit consent or knowledge. Since this has come to light, Path has <a href="http://blog.path.com/post/17274932484/we-are-sorry" title="Very sorry">apologized</a> (which is great) and updated their app so this behavior doesn&#8217;t happen without explicit user consent.</p>
<h2 id="weweretrainedforthismoment">We were trained for this moment</h2>
<p>For years now sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, et al have been asking people to login to their email service (gmail, yahoo, or whatever) and allow contact information to be extracted and used to pre-populate your account with contacts (e.g. Find friends, find followers, find people in your network).</p>
<p>I always considered this action to be shady. How could I know they weren&#8217;t keeping that information and selling it to spammers? How could I know they weren&#8217;t, say, reading my email? Most people, though, thought it was an acceptable trade off. Their new account would be up and running quickly, and they wouldn&#8217;t have to manually enter contacts or track down their friends.</p>
<p>Even though I find this &#8220;feature&#8221; to be a bit sketchy, at least it was an explicit request, followed by an explicit login. It&#8217;s safe to assume that the user knows what he&#8217;s intending when he clicks the &#8220;Import your gmail contacts&#8221; button.</p>
<p>People have become accustomed to this behavior, having used it for years now, so when you launch Path for the first time and all your friends are already there…it&#8217;s easy to assume you must have logged in somehow, or, more likely, you don&#8217;t even care how all your contacts showed up.</p>
<h2 id="areyousurprisedbythis">Are you surprised by this?</h2>
<p>Path claims that they were only using address book data to help users find each other on their service. I believe this is true, today. The problem of course is what happens to that data tomorrow. If Path gets bought out, what do the new owners do with that data? They have no explicit contract with the users of the application, so are they legally bound in any way? Probably not.</p>
<p>All social networks<a href="index.html#fn:fn-diaspora" id="fnref:fn-diaspora" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a> rely on vast amounts of demographic data as the basis of their business model. Facebook and Google use this demographic data to sell advertising. Twitter uses it to sell promoted tweets and trends.  This is why there are no well known, for-pay, public, social networks (that aren&#8217;t porn)<a href="index.html#fn:fn-no-google" id="fnref:fn-no-google" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a>. </p>
<p>After all the privacy problems discovered with Facebook and Google you simply must regard any and all social networking applications to be systems designed to extract your personal data and sell it. You are &#8220;paid&#8221; in return with a service you hopefully find fun or useful<a href="index.html#fn:fn-facebook" id="fnref:fn-facebook" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a>.</p>

</li>
<li id="fn:fn-no-google">
<p>This is also (partially) why I&#8217;m not on Google of Facebook any more. Another reason is that social networks feel like homework. I&#8217;m too old for homework.<a href="index.html#fnref:fn-no-google" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve recently switched to using <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/" title="quack">DuckDuckGo</a> as my primary search engine. DuckDuckGo has some <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/goodies.html" title="goodies">nice features</a> including a spiffy <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html" title="!bang">&#8220;bang&#8221; syntax</a> that lets you quickly proxy search results over to other sites and services. For example, if I wanted to quickly look up a PHP function I can search for &#8220;array unshift !php&#8221; and DuckDuckGo will push me right over to PHP.net&#8217;s function search. Nifty. More importantly though, the search results are good, useful, and not a cluttered mess of value-added, link sponsored, social media <a href="http://www.google.com">junk</a>.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo is also pretty serious about <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/privacy.html" title="privacy">privacy</a>. I&#8217;ve not been too <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5878987/googles-broken-promise-the-end-of-dont-be-evil">thrilled</a> with goings on at the Google, so this is the integrity frosting on the quality cake.</p>
<p>Chrome and Firefox both support DuckDuckGo as the default search engine. But silly Safari doesn&#8217;t allow search engines other than Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a nice little <a href="http://help.duckduckgo.com/customer/portal/articles/255650-hosts-file" title="host file hax">host file hack</a> that pushes any search queries to search.yahoo.com over to DuckDuckGo.</p>

				<p>I recently upgraded my iPhone and I am required by the Nerdy Web-person&#8217;s Guild to write about it. I try not to give into silly temptation and upgrade my phone every single year. The bi-annual upgrade cycle is silly enough. </p>
<p>The iPhone 4S is a huge step up from the 3GS in so many ways. It seems like a radically different device. The &#8220;Retina&#8221; display is shockingly sharp and so much easier on the eyes when reading an email or scanning a web site. The 4S (naturally) performs much, much better as well. I was pleasantly surprised to see &#8220;Grand Theft Auto 3&#8221; had been ported to the iPhone. If you can play games like this on your phone, why does anyone need an Xbox?</p>
<p>Siri is more useful than I expected. I find myself using Siri to get the weather, set timers, reminders, and appointments far more than anything else. For all of these actions, the speakable interface via Siri is faster than bonking around through a bunch of screens and forms to do the same task. If I drove more I&#8217;m sure the voice dialing and SMS features would be useful too.</p>
<p>None of this is new information to anyone who pays attention to iPhones. But maybe the interesting thing is that I chose to downgrade to a 16GB iPhone from a 32GB. I chose the large storage capacity for my 3GS because I liked the idea of carrying all of my music with me. In reality though, I&#8217;m rarely someplace where I can&#8217;t get to a particular song if I want it. I&#8217;m usually at home, or at my office where I&#8217;m on WiFi. Thanks to iTunes Match I can easily duplicate my iTunes library across all computers I use, or I can just download a song to my phone if I really need to and I&#8217;m away from my computer. </p>
<p>Also, my 3GS still exists. It did not evaporate the moment I bought a new iPhone. And since it exists I can use it as an iPod whenever I need all of my music.</p>
<h3 id="usinganoldiphoneasanipod">Using an old iPhone as an iPod</h3>
<p>The helpful fellow at the Apple Store recommended that I remove the SIM card from my old iPhone if I want to use it as an iPod. This is wrong, wrong, wrong. Unlike an iPod, an iPhone requires a SIM card (activated or not) in order for software restores and updates to run. If you yank out the SIM card, the phone will work &#8211; but if you need to do a restore or update the software it will go &#8216;bonk&#8217;. </p>
<p>I simply keep the old phone in &#8220;airplane mode&#8221;  with WiFi enabled. I&#8217;ve rearranged all the home screen icons so that the phone-y bits are all tucked away in their own folder where they won&#8217;t get poked at by accident.</p>
