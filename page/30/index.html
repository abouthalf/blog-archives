				<p>I&#8217;m a bachelor this weekend. I&#8217;m eating like a French sailor on leave in Italy.</p>
<p>If you ask nicely, the person who works at the fish counter in your local supermarket will probably just give you a big pile of fish bones for making stock. I came home with a pile of former salmon and turned them into stock.</p>
<div id="attachment_1429" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1429" title="The Thin Red Line of Salmon Fat" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/The-Thin-Red-Line-of-Salmon-Fat-360x480.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Thin Red Line of Salmon Fat</p></div>
<p>I wanted to make a seafood risotto. I started with my usual mirepoix and added sweet red peppers and cherry tomatoes. The rice cooked in the fish stock, and the dish was finished with tuna.</p>
<div id="attachment_1430" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1430" title="Veggies and rice" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Veggies-and-rice-360x480.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Veggies and rice</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve fallen in love with this over-priced, imported tuna, canned in olive oil. I sautéed the veggies in the oil from this can plus a little garlic, bay leaf, salt and pepper.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1428" title="Fancy Tuna" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Fancy-Tuna-360x480.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the finished dish.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1427" title="Al Fresco" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Al-Fresco-360x480.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p>Once the risotto is al dente I turn off the heat and cover the pan to let it rest for about 10 minutes. </p>
<p>&#8220;Al dente&#8221; is one of those dumb things that people say on television cooking shows without every saying why it&#8217;s important. </p>
<p>Pasta and risotto are delicate once cooked. Overcooking turns both to starchy mush. The trick to avoiding mush is to deliberately undercook pasta and risotto, just like with a nice steak. The pasta and risotto will continue to cook after you turn off the stove. Both the pan and the food itself retain quite a bit of heat energy and that remaining heat continues to cook the food. If you cook pasta or risotto till they&#8217;re perfectly done in the pan, by the time they hits your plate they will have been cooking the entire time, getting mushy and making you sad.</p>
<p>So you stop cooking early and allow the pasta or risotto to cross the finish line on its own using the residual heat. The result is just-done and never crunchy in the middle.</p>

				<p>My right rubber glove has a hole right in the crook of the thumb. Nobody wants dish-pan hands. I crossed the street to my local market to buy gloves and hopefully at least one other thing I needed so I wouldn&#8217;t have to be that guy who pays for rubber gloves with a debit card.</p>
<p>In line I saw a roughly 50 year old man who was clearly a body builder and proud. He sported a tank top and an insanely dark tan which could only produced through artificial means. His upper arms are just a bit smaller in circumference than my thighs. My first uncharitable thought was &#8220;put on a shirt, Guido&#8221; and then I felt bad. It&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t style my hair before going to the laundry room in the basement. Who am I to judge? I&#8217;m delighted to see an attractive woman in a figure flattering skirt in the summer time. Somebody, somewhere must surely appreciate the gun show. And even if no one does, he worked hard on those mighty biceps, he should be proud to show them off.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m thinking all this an old man wearing a veteran&#8217;s cap, walking on two canes ambles up to the body builder and says: &#8220;I was going to ask if you needed any help carrying those.&#8221; They both laughed and the body builder said &#8220;hey, you never know…&#8221; and thanked the old man for the complement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a jerk. </p>
<p>But at least I&#8217;m always very polite to the cashiers.</p>

				<p>I was listening to the latest episode of the <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/2/">New Old Talk Show</a> and the discussion turned to the low hanging fruit left for <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/">iOS</a>, that is, what are the obvious features or refinements iOS will likely appear in the next version (version 6).</p>
<p>A good example of low hanging fruit is &#8216;copy and paste&#8217;. This was not available on the original iOS (on the iPhone) but introduced later as part of a major update after a good mechanism was developed. </p>
<p>During the show, John and Adam dished about Apple getting their own maps provider (and abandoning Google for obvious competitive reasons). While I think an improved Maps app would be fantastic &#8211; I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s a critical feature. They also speculated about AppleTV apps. Maybe. That doesn&#8217;t help iPhones or iPads though.</p>
<p>iOS 5 brought iCloud backup and PC-free activation of an iOS device. iPhones (and iPods before them) began as computer peripherals. These were devices which slurped over some of your digital media, contacts, email, etc and let you carry them around with you wherever you go. Each iteration of these devices has increased their independence on a home PC. You may still want a PC to transfer big, honking music libraries over the first time you set up your new iPhone or iPad but you don&#8217;t really need to. You can download all of your iTunes purchases right to your phone&#8230;and if you pay for the great (cheap) iTunes Match service, all of your not-iTunes music is available too. This indicates the future direction of iOS. iOS will stand alone.</p>
<p>New apps like <a href="http://panic.com/dietcoda/">Diet Coda</a> show that iOS is fully capable of doing &#8216;real work&#8217;<a href="index.html#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and there are a great many productivity apps that let you write, organize, and create. All iOS apps, though, have the same problem: It&#8217;s very hard to share data or documents between applications. Secondarily, it&#8217;s hard to get documents out of an iPad or iPhone (shaking hard doesn&#8217;t work).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly simple to share a single document or a photo in iOS. If you&#8217;re working on a Pages document, and you want to send that document to someone, you simply tap the &#8216;Share&#8217; icon choose &#8216;email&#8217; or another option. But what if you want to send a KeyNote presentation, a Pages document, a Numbers spreadsheet, and a few photos? The way iOS works now, you must launch each app separately and send each type of document in its own email. One for the Pages doc, one for the KeyNote presentation, one for the Numbers spreadsheet, and one for the photos[^fn-derp]. That&#8217;s more than a little cumbersome, and certainly not an unusual use-case. </p>
<p>When I last visited my family, I helped my dad move some photos from his email to a thumb-drive so he could have them printed. I would love to replace their aging Mac Mini with an iPad and bluetooth keyboard. But that simple use-case is not possible with today&#8217;s iOS. Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4101?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US">Camera Connection Kit</a> only works to import photos, not export, and it only works with photos and video. It&#8217;s less common now to push files around like that&#8230;but it&#8217;s still an important feature for some people. And for my dad, it means he can&#8217;t replace his computer with a simpler, easy-to-use device because it lacks that one feature.</p>
<p>iCloud and DropBox support make it easier to get your files from an iOS device to a PC (where you can attach all the files at once to a single email or move a file to a thumb-drive) but this doesn&#8217;t really solve the whole problem. The DropBox app can&#8217;t send multiple files in an email (though you can copy/paste multiple links to files &#8211; hardly convenient). iCloud is invisible to the user. These two solutions are competing platforms and they still require a PC to be fully useful.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that in order to complete the transition of iOS to a completely independent computing platform, Apple will do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a &#8216;Documents&#8217; app or an iCloud browser app (iCistern?) to facilitate key file sharing or transferring operations.</li>
<li>Expand the sharing API to work two ways between apps (e.g. the Share button can now push or pull data or documents to or from receiving apps)</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 breaks down the conceptual and literal sandbox around each app. One of the reasons iOS is easier for many people to learn is that apps are compartmentalized. Photos are always in your photo app. Always. Emails are always in your Email app. Always. This drives nerds nuts. Nerds know that it&#8217;s all just data under the covers and can theoretically be smooshed around&#8230;but for non-nerds this tidy compartmentalization is easy to understand and learn and easy to remember. Therefore, as much as <em>I</em> would love a Documents app, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see one.</p>
<p>Option 2 is more iOS like and is what I imagine Apple will do. I can imagine that the &#8216;Share&#8217; button could now have a counterpart button called &#8216;Get&#8217; or &#8216;Grab&#8217; or &#8216;Slurp&#8217; or similar. &#8216;Share&#8217; pushes data away from the current app, &#8216;Get&#8217; pulls it in. Today the Share menu is a smallish pop-over menu that typically holds a few options like &#8216;Email&#8217;, &#8216;Message&#8217;, or &#8216;Print&#8217;. I can imagine &#8216;Share&#8217; opening a drawer like interface (like double-clicking the home button) which provides the same options as today, but also features App icons which are registered receivers of the data. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m in the Photos app and I want to include a photo in a document I&#8217;m writing in Pages. I tap &#8216;Share&#8217; and the new Share-drawer appears. I tap the &#8216;Pages&#8217; icon which reveals options like &#8220;Insert into a new document…&#8221; and &#8220;Insert into an existing document…&#8221;. The latter would let me select a document from iCloud. It&#8217;s easy to imagine &#8216;Share&#8217; pushing out to a thumb-drive or other storage device as well.</p>
<p>&#8216;Get&#8217; could work the same way, but in reverse. There&#8217;s already a model for this for any app which supports importing from your photo library. A panel is made available which lists your photos. This concept could be standardized and applied to all data. If I&#8217;m in Pages, and I want to import a photo, I tap &#8216;Get&#8217;, tap &#8216;Photos&#8217;, and select a photo. If I want to import a spreadsheet as a table, I tap &#8216;Get&#8217;, tap &#8216;Numbers&#8217; and select a spreadsheet. If further actions are required to import the selected data, the app could request those actions immediately after closing the &#8216;Get&#8217; panel.</p>
<p>So I guess this makes this post a WWDC prediction. If I&#8217;m right, buy me a donut.</p>

				<p>When I was very young Bugs Bunny taught me that good Americans, when they die, go to Paris. This is a perfectly good afterlife for most Americans, but I live in Portland, Oregon. When I die, if I&#8217;m a very-very-good-boy, I&#8217;ll work at <a href="http://madmen.wikia.com/wiki/Sterling_Cooper_Draper_Pryce">Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce</a> and commute home to Portland to go wine tasting on the weekends. I&#8217;ll probably keep the same apartment, accept with better wiring.</p>
<p>My wife has a friend who lives in McMinnville, Oregon &#8211; in the heart of Oregon wine country. Her friend lent us her home for the Memorial day weekend. We drove down to McMinnville, stopping at Burgerville on the way, on Saturday afternoon. We got down to the business of not doing much immediately.</p>
<p>We met up with friends and friends of friends at a restaurant where the friends and friends of friends were just finishing a late, lazy lunch. We left together and ambled through downtown McMinnville to Dominio Wines. Our host had a dog and funky orange glasses. We sampled their wines in the sun on their patio. Smack may have been talked. The friends of friends were on their way to some other place, so we parted ways. We found our way over to Fino in Fondo&#8217;s tasting room. They make salumi the old fashioned way from local hogs. My favorite had a hint of truffle.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_1327-480x358.jpg" alt="Salumi at Fino in Fondo" title="Salumi" width="480" height="358" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1406" /></p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_1303-180x240.jpg" alt="Three wives by Remy" title="Three wives by Remy" width="180" height="240" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1407" /></p>
<p>My wife&#8217;s friend recommended we stop by Remy Wines &#8211; they have only recently opened a tasting room. Like a lot of Oregon wineries, the tasting room is a garage with a board placed across two wine barrels; wine served on top. The place was crowded. A bus-load of bachelorettes showed up to tipple. We talked and sipped and suddenly I found myself talking to Remy herself. Remy is a surprisingly young looking woman with a shock of wild platinum blonde hair and a down-to-earth attitude. She was fun and answered my inane questions with grace and humor. She also makes lovely wine.</p>
<p>We finished the day by stopping at the local market to by beef and cream so I could make a meal fit for the big red wine we brought home. I grilled a rib-eye and sliced it thin. I grilled asparagus, and made fettucini Alfredo the right way (not too heavy).</p>
<p>The following day, we shared breakfast and the friend left us alone with the cat and the wine and the wineries. We decided to drive out to tiny Kristn Hill winery (too small for a web site even) and found the owner and winemaker out front passing out drink tickets and branded wine glasses for a measly $5. Eric makes some wonderful sparkling wines and some very nice port. Kristin Hill is a family affair. Brothers and nephews and such were all on hand to help us out and tell us stories and show us around their home-turned-winery. </p>
<p>Afterwards, we looked up and drove to Amity Vineyards. Amity Vineyards is a farm building surrounded by vineyards. The interior of the building has a one corner devoted to salesmanship, with a bar and product display. The rest of the room is devoted to storing wine in between tastings. Also: They have a dog! He&#8217;s a goo-boy.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_1326-480x359.jpg" alt="Terrible, horrible day" title="Terrible, horrible day" width="480" height="359" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1408" /></p>

<p>The Blue Goat restaurant is close by in Amity, Oregon. They source almost everything locally and bake excellent pizzas in the massive brick oven centered right in the dining room.</p>

<p>We finished they day by finishing wine by the fire pit in our friend&#8217;s back yard. All a 45 minute from home.</p>

				<p>After listening to the most recent (and previous) episodes of <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/78">Build and Analyze</a> I got to thinking about frameworks and when and why you might choose one.</p>
<p>In the previous episode Marco advised against bringing 3rd party frameworks into a controlled platform like iOS. His example was using a 3rd party data abstraction layer on top of (or instead of) CoreData. The reasoning being that if you rely on this 3rd party tool &#8211; and Apple makes a big change to <em>their</em> framework &#8211; you could find yourself in a world of pain. It might take months before your 3rd party data abstraction framework is updated to work with CoreData again. It might never be updated again ever. In either case you&#8217;re stuck with a major rewrite on your hands. In this hypothetical situation, you would have been better off just to suck it up and learn and use CoreData to begin with.</p>
<p>Marco goes on to say, though, using something small and less critical to your application, like an XML parsing library, is less risky. It&#8217;s probably pretty easy to replace an XML library if you have to.</p>
<p>In the current episode, a listener asked whether the same advice applied to spinning up a PHP web site to support an iOS app he was working on. Marco related his experience of hating CakePHP (agreed) and ultimately writing his own framework just to fit his needs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t debate his advice, but it did get me to thinking about the topic of frameworks and how to evaluate them.</p>
<h2 id="aframe-what">A frame-what?</h2>
<p>Software frameworks are so varied in scope, purpose, and scale it&#8217;s hard to talk about them conceptually &#8211; but when people say &#8220;I need a web app to support my iOS app&#8221; I can infer a couple of things about what they need and therefor what they mean by &#8216;framework&#8217;.</p>
<p>In general a &#8216;software framework&#8217; is a conceptual model for solving a problem and a code library which attempts to solve that problem. Doctrine, ActiveRecord, and Hibernate are data access frameworks whose job it is to simplify persisting data in object oriented software applications. CocoaToach is the iOS framework for touch-based user interface applications. Rails, Grails, Spring, Django, Drupal, and Zend Framework are meta-frameworks which all incorporate other frameworks in order to simplify the production of websites. They combine data access frameworks, deployment frameworks, HTTP request routing frameworks, and the like together into a single package.</p>
<p>Marco&#8217;s listener was probably thinking about one of these large, general purpose, meta-web-frameworks. I think this is the case because a web app which needs to support multiple iOS clients probably needs a way to expose an api to the iOS app, and a web interface for the same api. A big framework like Rails or Zend would allow something like that fairly easily (that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the right choice for him though).</p>
<h2 id="justwhatareyoutryingtoaccomplishanyway">Just what are you trying to accomplish anyway</h2>
<p>Learning a framework can be its own reward. Many big IT shops standardize on a framework or two (for good or ill) and knowing the framework they use can be a leg up in getting hired. Also a learning a framework is a good exercise in learning a programming language or a platform. Learning to &#8220;hello world&#8221; in java is not terribly useful. But if you build and deploy a small web app with Spring you&#8217;ll learn a lot about how java applications are put together, what the pain-points are, and have something to talk about during a job interview.</p>
<p>The knowledge gained when learning a framework is transferrable. Once you understand what an &#8220;MVC&#8221; is you can apply those concepts to your own custom code or to other frameworks.</p>
<p>But choosing a framework for a new project requires that you understand the job you need to be done, and what the framework is capable of doing.</p>
<p>So. If what you need is a web API, maybe what you need is a means to route HTTP requests to code. You don&#8217;t need a full web stack &#8211; maybe all you need is something like Sinatra or Silex. It&#8217;s not particularly <em>hard</em> to write code which routes URLs to methods or functions…but unless your goal is to write code which routes URLs to functions, you probably shouldn&#8217;t spend your time on it. You probably should spend your time on solving the business problems of your app (there&#8217;s no framework for that).</p>
<p>If you need to crank out lots of custom web sites or web apps, each one a little different, each one with it&#8217;s own set of differing requirements &#8211; or if you need to create a very large site which needs to add or change features often &#8211; a full stack web framework like Rails, Spring, or Zend might be a better choice. If you need to make lots of web sites that all share very similar features&#8230;perhaps you should consider a modular tool like Drupal.</p>
<p>If you want to host a blog, you should sign up for a Tumblr account, because that problem has been solved already. If you want to host a wiki, you should download MediaWiki, because that problem has been solved already.</p>
<p>The point I&#8217;m narrowing down to, is that frameworks exist to solve particular problems and they do they&#8217;re best work when you can pass off that specific problem to the framework and focus on the critical portions of your project.</p>
<p>If you have to do lots of customization or tweaking to an existing framework to do what you want, then you have chosen poorly and you&#8217;re wasting your time.</p>
<h2 id="babysgonnamakeitonherown">Baby&#8217;s gonna make it on her own</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a good learning experience to write your own framework. It might also be fun to do. But when you&#8217;re faced with goal oriented project you need to consider if the project goals will be met better, faster, or both by going solo. If the answer is &#8216;no&#8217; you probably shouldn&#8217;t write a framework yourself.</p>

				<p>Oh tacos. You&#8217;re the only ones who understand me.</p>
<p>I made carnitas for tacos for some coworkers and friends the other evening. Recipes were demanded. So here, go forth and make your own delicious tacos.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 4&#8211;5 lb boneless pork shoulder (aka pork butt)</li>
<li>1 large onion</li>
<li>2&#8211;3 smashed garlic cloves</li>
<li>1 quart of chicken stock</li>
<li>Water if needed</li>
<li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
<li>1/2 tsp ground paprika</li>
<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>2 Ancho chiles (dried poblano chiles)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<p>Using scissors, snip the stem-end of the chiles off. Shake out as many seeds as possible. Discard seeds and stems. Place the chiles in a small bowl of water for 20 to 30 minutes, or until soft.</p>
<p>Cut the onion into large chunks. Cut the pork shoulder into large chunks, approximately 1 1/2 inches.</p>
<p>Place garlic, onion, and pork into a large lidded pot. Sprinkle cumin, paprika, and oregano into the pot. Stir to coat evenly. Add bay leaf.</p>
<p>Remove the ancho chiles from the water. Add the chile water to the pot with the pork and onions. Split the chiles length-wise and wash out any remaining seeds. Roughly dice the chiles and add to the pot.</p>
<p>Add chicken stock to pot. If needed, add enough water to just barely cover all contents of the pot.</p>
<p>Place pot over high heat and bring stock to a rolling boil for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to simmer. Simmer for 3 to 5 hours, stirring occasionally, cooking away all the liquid.</p>
<p>Once all the liquid has evaporated or has been absorbed, the onions and pork should fall apart with gentle stirring.</p>
<p>Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Spread the pork mixture into the pan and place in a 400º F oven until the meat is slightly crispy.</p>
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>Chicken stock will likely have more than enough salt to season the pork, however if you make your own stock or use salt-free stock, you may wish to season the pork with 1/4 tsp of salt in addition to the other spices.</p>

				<p>At my job we use a number of web based applications for every-day work: a ticketing/bug tracking tool, a code review tool, a company wiki, a source control repository browser, a database administration tool, and of course the actual product we develop. I have most of these web sites open all day, every day. I would start my day launching my browser, then opening a bookmarked folder as tabs &#8211; so each little web app would have it’s own tab in the right order. Then I’d have <em>another</em> browser window open to my local copy of our product, with a tab open to the staging server. If I needed to go read documentation for something online, I’d have yet another browser window open for that.</p>
<p>This teetering arrangement of browser tabs would then fall apart when I clicked a link to a ticket in an email notification (opening yet another tab in the wrong browser window). Once I accidentally destroyed a live database table because I got my windows mixed up. Whoops.</p>
<p>With iron resolve and kung-fu like discipline you might be able to keep only one window or tab open at a time, closing out all others as soon as you’re focus shifts. Unfortunately I’m fresh out of iron resolve and my kung-fu is weak.</p>
<h2 id="fluid">Fluid</h2>
<p><a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> is a app that lets you turn websites into an app for your mac. Fluid creates a web browser that loads only one page. For example, if you use Google Docs you could launch Fluid, give it the URL for docs, give it a name (like ‘Docs’), and optionally give it an icon.</p>
<p>Fluid will create “Docs.app” and save it in your Applications folder. You can double click the app icon and go right to Google Docs. The app works just like any Mac app. It shows up in Launchpad, Spotlight search, in your dock, and when you Command-tab to switch applications.</p>
<p>At work I have a fluid app set up for all of our work apps. This way I always know what window is what (they have icons!) and it’s fast and easy to launch or shut down one of these apps without messing with my browser. If I crash my web browser while dinking around with JavaScript, my web apps stay open.</p>
<p>The basic version of Fluid is free, but for $4.99 you can upgrade to get features like full screen mode (in Lion) and other neato features. It’s cheap. Support your indie software developer.</p>
<h2 id="browserfairy">Browser Fairy</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1391" title="browser_fairy_logo_big-300x300" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/browser_fairy_logo_big-300x300-240x240.png" alt="" width="240" height="240" />Having all my web apps in their own application is great, but if I got an email notification to a bug or wiki update, the links would still open in my default browser. Now I’ve got the bug tracker open in two places. Boo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.catchingtales.com/osx/browserfairy/">Browser Fairy</a> is an app available in the Mac App <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/browser-fairy/id483014855?mt=12">store</a> which sort of sits between links and any browser you have installed.</p>
<p>You set up Browser Fairy by making it your default browser. Then you tell Browser Fairy about all the browsers on your system. When you click on any URL anywhere, Browser Fairy intercepts it, and then re-routes it to a browser your choose.</p>
<p>For example, if your company’s timesheet tool only works in Firefox, you give Browser Fairy the base url (maybe http://timesheet.jobbity.job) and anytime you you click a link to the timesheet app, it will automatically open in Firefox, while all of your other links open in Safari.</p>
<p>Since Fluid apps are just single-serving web browsers, Browser Fairy treats them like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. So I can configure wiki links to go to my wiki app, bug links to the bug tracker, code reviews to the code review app, etc. All other links go to Safari.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit of work to configure, but you only have to do it once &#8211; and once it’s done it’s like magic. Any time I get a bug notification email, the link opens my bug tracking app, not my main web browser. If the bug tracking app isn’t open…Browser Fairy will <em>open it</em> so I don’t have to keep 10 things open all the time.</p>
<p>Browser Fairy is $4.99 in the App Store &#8211; with Fluid apps they’re a super-duper productivity enhancing duo.</p>

				<p>Recently I tried out the <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/">Silex</a> micro framework, creating <a href="http://bgrounder.abouthalf.com/">bGrounder</a> in the process. Getting Silex up and running on my Mac was easy-peasy. Create a new directory in my ~/Sites folder. Download the Silex PHAR (PHP archive) file. Create an application <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/usage.html#bootstrap">bootstrap</a> file. Go.</p>
<p>I ran into trouble when I pushed my work up to my Dreamhost account. The application was failing silently. Running silex.phar on the command line resulted in meaningless errors.</p>
<p>After a fair bit of <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">Duck-Duck-Go-ing</a> (Duck-Duck-Goosing? Quacking?) I found squat. After dumping out a PHP info page I realized that Dreamhost is using <a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/">Suhosin</a> (which is a good thing). This was the culprit.</p>
<p>The Silex documentation provides <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/usage.html#php-configuration">configuration examples</a> showing how to configure PHP and Suhosin to work with the Silex framework. Fortunately, Dreamhost lets you override the system default PHP.ini with your own.</p>
<p>In order to this work you should have PHP 5.3.x FastCGI enabled for your domain. Leave “Extra web security” on so you feel snuggly and safe in your bed at night.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1382" title="Domain php settings" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/domain-php-settings-480x111.png" alt="Settings for PHP" width="480" height="111" /></p>
<p>Make sure your login account (your FTP user) has shell access enabled &#8211; this configuration cannot be done without shell access.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Php.ini#Replace_the_system_php.ini_entirely">Follow the instructions on the Dreamhost support wiki for replacing the system php.ini</a>. If you don’t know what any of those instructions mean, this is not for you. Contact support and ask nicely for them to do it for you.</p>
<p>Once you have a shiny new ini file (the file will be named “phpini”) look for the following line:</p>
<pre><code>;;; VALUES BELOW WILL OVERRIDE ANY SET ABOVE! </code></pre>
<p>Above this line are system defaults. Leave them be. Below this line you will add your customizations.</p>
<p>Add the following recommended configurations from the Silex documentation:</p>
<pre><code>detect_unicode = Off
phar.readonly = Off
phar.require_hash = Off
suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = phar </code></pre>
<p>And then add the following to ensure that the PHAR extension is loaded:</p>
<pre><code>extension=phar.so </code></pre>
<p>Then follow the <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Php.ini#Replace_the_system_php.ini_entirely">Dreamhost instructions</a> for forcing PHP to reload the configuration &#8211; or go make some coffee and come back in 15 minutes or so. Dreamhost will eventually reload the configs automatically.</p>
<p>Silex should now run fine, both in the browser and on the command line. Of course your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>I understand his pain, but his recipe is too dry. 3 parts gin to 1 part vermouth, people. At a 5 to 1 ratio, you may as well just drink gin on the rocks.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t keep your vermouth at room temperature &#8211; unless you consume it quickly. Vermouth is wine. It spoils.</p>
<p>He is right that it&#8217;s hard to get a well made martini in many places. That&#8217;s because most bartenders are taught how to make Vodka martinis, which is basically just chilled and shaken vodka (fine if you like that sort of thing bro). They simply substitute gin when asked. This results in a cocktail that tastes cold, antiseptic, and like a waste of money.</p>
<p>Here in Portland, though, you can find many bartenders who know what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
