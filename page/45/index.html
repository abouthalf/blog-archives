				<p>The Steve-note is online at Apple&#8217;s web site. If you care about such things, you&#8217;ve already watched it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t, it is a great opportunity to see the best salesman of our time in action.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/s83522y/event/index.html?internal=g4h5jl83a">http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/s83522y/event/index.html?internal=g4h5jl83a</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard the old phrase &#8220;He could sell [stereotype] to [ethnicity]&#8221;. Well <em>he could</em>.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, if you care about information design and the art of communication, watch his presentation.</p>
<p>This is probably the only time you&#8217;ll see the CEO of a company get real applause &#8212; but more importantly watch his slides carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no bullet points</li>
<li>There is no point in the presentation where he reads from the slide</li>
<li>Almost every slide is a strong, simple image or graphic</li>
<li>Text is minimally used and always underscores important-to-remember facts (like sales totals or battery life)</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve Jobs uses Apple&#8217;s Keynote instead of the ubiquitous Microsoft Powerpoint. But that doesn&#8217;t matter. Skilled hands can create garbage in any software environment. The real magic here is that he has a script, and the slides are his accompaniment. His slides are like Dean Martin. They aren&#8217;t a crutch, they back up what he&#8217;s saying, so what he&#8217;s saying becomes the focus.</p>
<p>Notice all the little touches to the presentation. For example when he demonstrates a product, the slide reads &#8220;Demo&#8221; in an informal italic typeface. This indicates to the audience &#8220;go watch Steve now&#8221;. </p>
<p>Since this presentation is about iPods, music is liberally used throughout the presentation. However music is treated like a reward for a task. When Jobs demos searching for and purchasing a song in the iTunes WiFi store, he rewards the viewer with 10 or 15 seconds of John Lennon (and his iconic visage displayed on the large virtual iPod screen).</p>
<p>If you have a presentation coming up, do yourself a favor. Spend an hour watching this presentation, take notes, and steal some ideas.</p>

				<p>I came across this interesting blog post about uninstalling MS Word and never ever using it again.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenpoole.net/blog/goodbye-cruel-word/">http://stevenpoole.net/blog/goodbye-cruel-word/</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice read, though it&#8217;s basically a love letter to the new brand of hipster full screen anti-word processors like <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/writeroom">Writeroom</a> and <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivner</a>. (These products seem nice for someone who a.) gets to use a Mac at work and b.) must crank out X number of words a day. I am neither of these people. But I would gladly try out Scrivner the next time I had a big giant piece to write, like maybe a big project proposal)</p>
<p>Poole writes about how MS Word has gotten bigger and bigger and more and more cluttered over the years. He writes about how hard it has become to actually <em>write</em> with Word any more.</p>
<p>This resonated with me pretty hard. I have been facing the same kind of decision.</p>
<p>I am using the 30 day iWork trial at home and I find that Numbers meets all of my <em>personal</em> and <em>business</em> spreadsheet needs. I don&#8217;t do any serious number crunching at home. I&#8217;m not an accountant (ahem: There&#8217;s no accountin&#8217; for me anyways. thank you.)</p>
<p>I need a spreadsheet for the three following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean up data for importing into a database</li>
<li>Simple home number crunching &#8211; like &#8220;what&#8217;s my bank account going to look like at the end of the month&#8221;</li>
<li>Creation of invoices for my freelance work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers does all this very well &#8212; and in fact does things like invoicing better because the result is so much more graphically pleasing. (I&#8217;ve tried purpose built invoicing tools. These are typically overkill for my kind of work, and you&#8217;re basically paying for a custom Excel template wrapped up in a wonky format anyway. That&#8217;s dumb. Oh, and Quicken sucks.)</p>
<p>My word processing needs are equally small. I need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a letter</li>
<li>Print an envelope</li>
<li>Write a résumé</li>
<li>Write up some short multi-page documents like a project proposal (which Pages has a nice template for)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, basically I need about 1/3 of MS Office. I haven&#8217;t used Excel or Word in about a month or so, and I&#8217;m strongly considering just removing it from my computer altogether.</p>
<p>Pages and Numbers does everything I need it to. I don&#8217;t really need PowerPoint or Keynote. I suppose I might someday, and if I do great. (But I generally believe that PowerPoint is for marketing knobs and for real use*)</p>
<p>Another reason for me to move to iWork (or even NeoOffice) is that Microsoft isn&#8217;t going to have a Universal Binary version of Office until 2008. Then, if I&#8217;m lucky, I&#8217;ll have the opportunity to pay $300 for an upgrade that will run at normal speeds on my machine. Thanks, no.</p>
<p>In fact, there has only been one compelling reason for me to upgrade MS Office ever. The first version I purchased was for Mac OS 9. I bought an upgrade when a version for OS X shipped. That&#8217;s it. I think I&#8217;ve missed two versions maybe. I don&#8217;t know. The upcoming universal binary would have been the next compelling reason, but I won&#8217;t be doing that. iWork is universal binary of course, is available yesterday, and costs $79. An updated MS Office doesn&#8217;t exist yet, and will undoubtedly cost at least $300.</p>
<p>My only lingering doubt about yanking Office off my computer is that I know, I just know, somebody somewhere is going to send me some wonky Office document that Pages won&#8217;t open or something, and I&#8217;ll need office to use it. However, I do have NeoOffice installed &#8212; I can probably safely bet that if it won&#8217;t open in Pages, it will open in NeoOffice. And if it doesn&#8217;t open in either I could just request that they send it again in plain text format.</p>
<p>*disclosure &#8211; at work I advocate all &#8220;wireframe&#8221; or user interface documents be made in PowerPoint and hopefully saved to PDF instead of that horrible thing called Visio. People have Acrobat or PowerPoint on their machine. The lowly analyst who inherits the UI document can edit a PowerPoint file&#8230;but they may or may not have Viso and may or may not know how to use it.</p>

InDesign is Adobe&#8217;s prepress, page layout application. It&#8217;s intended for the design and production of magazines, books, and other print pieces. It includes some XML support, so it&#8217;s forward looking to the time when much of our documents will be data driven (instead of design once, print many, design again print again)
</p>
<p>
Many of the tools InDesign employs to speed along print design can be used in the creation of schematics and prototypes of your web site projects.
</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p>Many of the same kinds of features exist in other pre-press applications like Quark Express and Adobe Pagemaker. The same concepts should apply in general, though InDesign&#8217;s PDF workflow provides some advantages over other applications.</p>
</div>
<h2>What makes a good web site prototype?</h2>
<p>
Prototypes (or &ldquo;schematics,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wire frames&rdquo;) for web sites help to determine and communicate three elements of a new web site.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Basic structure</dt>
<dd>	The basic structure of a web page includes the major divisions of content and function.</dd>
<dt>Basic Function</dt>
<dd>	A web site prototype will help communicate the major steps that a user takes to complete a particular task e.g. adding an item to a shopping cart or searching for content.</dd>
<dt>Basic Layout or Design</dt>
<dd>	Basic design or layout means the foundational or structural design of each page. This includes navigation, page divisions (e.g. content here, sub navigation here), the layout of form fields, the layout of dynamic or templated content (e.g. product image goes here). This does not mean typeface choice, color choices, graphic design, or page styling. These things come second after the structure, just like you build the foundation for your house before you pick out the carpet.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that graphic design and styling is not important. It is very important to communicating brand or corporate identity, and contributes quite a lot to the usability and pleasure of using a web site. However, your web site should function without color, graphics, and fancy styling, just like your house would function without drapes.</p>
</div>
<p>
Good prototypes should also have the following characteristics:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Black and White.</dt>
<dd>	Prototypes, at least in the beginning should  focus on form and function. Graphics, styling, or a lot of color will only distract from the form and function. (if you were to color code navigational areas say, blue and content areas yellow, you will inevitably have a client or member of your marketing team ask &ldquo;can&#8217;t we make that red or some other color?&rdquo; While in black and white everyone will (hopefully) understand it&#8217;s a plan or blueprint, not a suggestion for visual design.)</dd>
<dt>Scribble-able</dt>
<dd>	A good prototype should be printable and passed out to members of the development team during meetings for people to make notes, doodle in extra features if needed. If during the course of your meetings you discover that you need a new link on the home page, you can simply <em>write it in</em>. These notes can be photocopied and passed back to the developers to include in the next round of prototyping. Printable documents can be read anywhere, don&#8217;t require a network connection, and don&#8217;t suffer from computer glitches or network downtime.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<h2>Why prototype using InDesign or paper instead of HTML?</h2>
<p>
An HTML wiz-kid could bang out a good prototype by hand-coding or in Dreamweaver pretty quickly, maybe even faster than you could with InDesign or a similar application.
</p>
<p>
The problem is once you start working with HTML and viewing the results of the work in a browser, <strong>you are no longer prototyping, but working on a web page</strong>.
</p>
<p>
In order to make the navigation consistent in all pages the web designer or developer will start writing includes, or making templates, therefore deviating  from dealing in general concepts.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of prototyping is to plan and develop ideas and concepts, not to fidget with HTML.
</p>
<p>
Also an HTML prototype requires a computer and a browser to really work properly. It will only print properly if your web developer spends time making printable version.
</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m obviously referring to the early phases of design and planning. At some point there will obviously have to be a development web site available for testing and critique. By that point however, all the big questions of design, format, and structure should be answered.</p>
</div>
<h3>Other benefits to InDesign</h3>
<p>
InDesign can export to PDF format <em>and</em> to HTML. This gives you options in how you present your prototype.
</p>
<p>
This means you can show your prototype over the web with working links, within Adobe Acrobat <em>also</em> with working links, or printed from the exported PDF for round-table discussion. More options is always better.
</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p>InDesign&#8217;s HTML export is a complicated animal. For quick exporting of prototypes for use in meetings or getting feedback it should work fine, though I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it for any HTML production without really learning the ins and outs of the export tool.</p>
</div>
<p>
Once the initial phase of prototyping is completed, the InDesign document can be passed to a graphic designer who can add visual design and styling to the prototype. Using master pages will propagate theses changes throughout the prototype quickly. Starting with a single structural prototype, the designer can easily create a few different looks quickly based on the same structure.
</p>
<p>
Now the &ldquo;full&rdquo; paper prototype with visual design can be viewed on screen, or in print for design discussions and development.
</p>
<p>
In this way a &ldquo;low-fidelity&rdquo; prototype can quickly become a &ldquo;high-fidelity&rdquo; prototype complete with graphics, type, and styling.
</p>
<h2>Methods for Prototyping in Adobe InDesign</h2>
<p>
Your InDesign prototype should begin with a new document. Set your page setup to &ldquo;landscape.&rdquo; This will mimic the horizontal format of the screen, but still print easily on standard paper.
</p>
<p>
I usually set my Units to points, which are roughly analogous to pixels. This helps to ground the design in the proper framework more than providing a pixel perfect layout solution.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of this article I have started a simple prototype of a blogging tool built for my hypothetical friend Billy. The sample includes a blog entry screen and a blog preferences screen. Just enough to illustrate the concepts.

<h3>Tools of the trade</h3>
<div class="float-r" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/UI-widgets.png" alt="Sample UI Widgets" width="146" height="400" border="0" />
</div>
<p>
In order to make prototyping fast and productive, it helps to not have to recreate standard browser widgets every time you need to add a text field.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve developed a set of generic user interface widgets that you might find in any HTML form.
</p>
<p>
Included in this set are a search form, and a &ldquo;jump menu&rdquo; as those are common &ldquo;widget clusters&rdquo; that are used in web sites. The other form elements are there, checkboxes, radio buttons, text fields, menus, etc.
</p>
<p>
A library in InDesign is a collection of vector art (&ldquo;geometry&rdquo;), images, text, or whatever objects you might want to reuse. The library is a discreet file, and can be opened and used with several InDesign documents.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve placed these standard UI widgets into an InDesign Library for easy use. Simply click and drag the widget onto the page where needed. Rename buttons or menu items with the type tool. Reshape as needed.
</p>
<p>
The widgets themselves are all vector art. This allows them to scale to whatever size you need. It also means not having to keep up with a bunch of bit mapped images for prototyping.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve bundled the UI Widget library along with an Illustrator EPS file, and a standard Illustrator document into a ZIP archive for easy use. If you don&#8217;t use InDesign, you should be able to extract the widgets from either of the Illustrator files.
</p>

<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
Once you have created a new document, you will want to establish your default settings for link color and text.
</p>
<p>
Bring up the Swatches pallette from the Window menu (Window -> Swatches) or via the F5 key. Click the new swatch icon (small page) at the lower right of the pallette next to the trash can icon.
</p>
<p>
You may wish to pick from the Web Color pallette for a web safe text color.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/new-color-swatch.png" alt="Choose Web Safe Color Pallette" width="383" height="400" border="0" /></p>
<p>
Choose at least one color for your basic hyperlink text. You probably won&#8217;t need more than one link color. Remember, your job here is to show what and where the links are, you aren&#8217;t styling the page.
</p>
<p>
With a link color chosen, bring up the Character Styles pallette from the Type menu (Type->Character Styles) or by pressing Shift and F11.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/character-styles-pallette.png" alt="" width="240" height="213" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
Click the page icon to create a new character style.
</p>
<p>
A character style is a set of named typeface settings. You can choose your typeface, size, color, style (underlined, bold, etc).
</p>
<p>
I made a character style for Headings level 1 through 3, a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; character style for all paragraph and body copy. And a &ldquo;link&rdquo; character style using the color I created above, with the type style set to underlined.
</p>
<p>
You may wish to add other type styles if your prototype demands them. Try and keep your type styles limited to semantic definitions. Headings, lists, paragraphs, abbreviations, address, etc. You want to avoid fussing with visual style at this stage.
</p>

<div class="pull-quote">
<p>I recommend using a simple typeface like Arial or Helvetica. It will be easy to read, and will not imply a specific design direction to heavily.</p>
</div>
<h3>Using Master Pages</h3>
<p>
Most web sites use a standardized framework (or &ldquo;chrome&rdquo;) for placing the navigational elements, corporate identity, etc.
</p>
<p>
This framework should be built on the first master page (A-Master) in InDesign. All elements on the master page will be automatically copied to each page that has the master &ldquo;applied&rdquo; to it.
</p>
<p>
Bring up the pages pallette from the Window menu, if it isn&#8217;t already available (Window -> Pages) or by the F12 key.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/pages-pallette.png" alt="Pages Pallette" width="236" height="239" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
From the pages pallette you can create edit master pages, create new master pages, and create and reorder document pages.
</p>
<p>
Double click A-Master to open it in the document window.
</p>
<p>
Create all of your web site &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; here, including global navigation links (links that will be used and accessible throughout your site).
</p>
<p>
Our sample looks like this:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/master-page-large.gif"><img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/master-page-small.gif" alt="Billyblog Prototype Master Page" width="300" height="225" border="0" class="basic-border" /><br />
Click To Enlarge</a>
</p>
<p>
Notice the global links &ldquo;Posts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Links,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Archives.&rdquo; These links will appear on every page made from the A-Master.
</p>
<p>
Try editing this page in the sample document. You will notice that every page in the document reflects your changes. Handy.
</p>
<p>
To create a new page in the prototype based on this master page, click on the Master in the top half of the pages pallette, and drag it down into the bottom half. You can drag it to the end of your list of pages to make a new page at the end of the document, or drag it some place in between.
</p>
<h4>Master pages and sub-sections</h4>
<p>
Any complex web site will have many sections of content, often times with their own sub-navigation. A product catalog is a good example.
</p>
<p>
Again, using a master page for this can prevent you from copying and pasting a sub-navigation design to 12 different pages.
</p>
<p>
The trick is to create a master page based on the first master page. This way the global links and browser chrome are copied into the new master page, and therefore copied into any pages made with the new master page.
</p>
<p>
To make a new master page, click the triangle in the upper right corner of the pages pallette to open an options menu.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/add-new-master.png" alt="Add a new master page" width="300" height="230" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
Choose &ldquo;New Master&rdquo; from the menu.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/new-master-settings.png" alt="New Master Page Settings" width="300" height="115" border="0" /></p>
<p>
Name the new master something relevant to the purpose of the section (like &ldquo;Products Master&rdquo; for a product page master). On the menu labeled &ldquo;Based On Master&rdquo; choose the A-Master page.
</p>
<p>
Add any new section elements to this new master (sub-navigation, bread crumb trail navigation, headings, etc). Use this master just like the original master page, dragging it from the top half of the pallette to the bottom half to make a new page.
</p>
<h3>Linking</h3>
<p>
InDesign supports hyperlinking within documents as well as links to web addresses. These links are maintained when you export the document to PDF or to HTML and clickable. This means that someone looking at your prototype in a browser or in Acrobat can get a sense of how the site &ldquo;flows&rdquo; and what happens after you submit which form.
</p>
<h4>You need a place to link to</h4>
<p>
It is less confusing to build the destinations of your links in InDesign first, then create your links.
</p>
<p>
You may want to create all the pages in your prototype at once, and then create links. Or work on links incrementally as you complete a page or section.
</p>
<p>
Once you have a page that will be a destination for a link. You will set it as a hyperlink destination.
</p>
<p>
Bring up the Hyperlinks pallette from the Window menu (Window->Hyperlinks) or by pressing Shift and F7.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/hyperlinks-pallette.png" alt="Hyperlinks pallette" width="237" height="135" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
Click the triangle in the upper right corner of the pallette to open the options menu. Choose &#8220;New Hyperlink Destination.&#8221;
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/new_hyperlink-destination-m.png" alt="Choose New HyperLink Destination" width="400" height="242" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
Set the type of your new hyperlink destination to &ldquo;Page.&rdquo; Give the destination a recognizable name such as an abbreviation of the page you are linking to (you will need this to tell one link destination from another later).
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/hyperlink_destination_setti.png" alt="Hyperlink Destination Settings" width="400" height="167" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
Make sure the Page number matches the number of the page you are linking to.
</p>
<p>
Set the &ldquo;Zoom Setting&rdquo; to &ldquo;Fit In Window&rdquo; to have each page zoom out to fit the screen in Acrobat after the link is clicked.</p>
<h4>Making a new link</h4>
<p>
Once you have a link destination, you can make a link.
</p>
<p>
Select the object or text that will function as the link.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/select-type-for-link.png" alt="Select type for link" width="246" height="171" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
Click the page icon on the Hyperlinks pallette to create a new link.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/new-hyperlink.png" alt="New Hyperlink Settings" width="400" height="266" border="0" />
</p>
<p>Give the link a name to identify it on the Hyperlinks Pallette. You can double-click on any link listed on the pallette to edit.</p>
<p>
Choose the hyperlink destination from the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; menu. Set the Type to &ldquo;Invisible Rectangle&rdquo; (otherwise your hyperlinks will have big ugly boxes around them). Make sure the type is set to &ldquo;Page.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>If you make a link on a Master page, that link will be copied to every page which uses that master.</p>
<h2>PDF Exporting</h2>
<div class="float-l" style="width: 153px;"><img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/file-export.png" alt="File, Export to create a pdf" border="0" width="153" height="300" /></div>
<p>
When you&#8217;ve finished with your prototype, or you&#8217;ve done enough that you want to print it out and look it over, you will want to export it as a PDF.
</p>
<p>
Choose &ldquo;Export&rdquo; from the file menu.
</p>
<p>
Select &ldquo;General&rdquo; from the left hand pane. Select a PDF Style from the menu. I&#8217;ve found the eBook settings to work well.
</p>
<p>
Make sure the &ldquo;Include Hyperlinks&rdquo; checkbox is checked in order to keep your links in the PDF.
</p>
<p>Click Export and save your PDF file.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../examples/web_site_prototyping/export-preferences.png" alt="PDF Export Preferences" width="400" height="370" border="0" />
</p>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>
I prefer exporting to PDF as it is more versatile. You can print it, email it, and it&#8217;s all contained in one editable file. Designers could crack it open in Acrobat and tweak if they wanted, or work with the original file.
</p>
<p>
HTML output is also an option. I find it less useful as it immediately ties the prototype to a browser and will not print as well without crafting printer friendly styles.
</p>
<p>
Prototypes should be tools for structuring a project, figuring out what goes where and who comes first, and finally for spotting potential problems before they become coded into HTML, integrated into a server side scripting language and tied into a database.

				<p>John Kricfalusi (you know, the Ren &amp; Stimpy guy) has been blogging about cartoon color theory using examples from high art (like Yogi Bear) all the way to low end crap like direct-to-video Disney schlock.</p>

<p>Yes. It&#8217;s a lot of links. But it&#8217;s mostly pictures!</p>
<p>My recipe for a no-fail color scheme for a web site?<br />
Simple:</p>
<p>In Photoshop, create a new document that is 300 pixels wide<br />
by 100 pixels tall. Divide the image into three equal<br />
boxes, each 100 pixels square.</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="blank color scheme" src="../../files/page11_1.jpg" width="427" height="270" /></p>
<p>Pick one color you like. Any color. How about&#8230;Abouthalf orange? (#FF9933) Use the Marquee tool and the Paint Bucket tool to fill the first box with your color:</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="one color" src="../../files/page11_2.jpg" width="427" height="270" /></p>
<p>Use the Marquee tool to select the second box, and<br />
fill it with your color again:</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_3" src="../../files/page11_3.jpg" width="427" height="270" /></p>
<p>Then invert the color using the Invert command under the Image-&gt;Adjustments menu. (or Command+I on a Mac, Control+I on Windows)</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_4" src="../../files/page11_4.jpg" width="427" height="270" /></p>
<p>Fill the third square with this new color too:</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_5" src="../../files/page11_5.jpg" width="427" height="270" /></p>
<p>Add a new layer to the file, then set the Opacity to 50%:</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_6" src="../../files/page11_6.jpg" width="206" height="332" /></p>
<p>On the second layer, fill the third square with white (which at 50% opacity will tint the layer beneath):</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_7" src="../../files/page11_7.jpg" width="427" height="270" /></p>
<p>Add <em>another</em> new layer at 50% Opacity</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_8" src="../../files/page11_8.jpg" width="206" height="332" /></p>
<p>Then fill the <em>second and third</em> squares with white again:</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_9" src="../../files/page11_9.jpg" width="427" height="270" /></p>
<p>Now, use the first color as your &#8220;main&#8221; color &ndash; for logos, headers, etc.Use white as your background color, and use the other colors as accents, like the colors for links, or borders, or what have you. Here are some more examples, with white added on at the end:</p>
<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="page0_blog_entry60_10" src="../../files/page11_10.jpg" width="496" height="525" /></p>
<p>Now, you may not always get a winner, but it&#8217;s a fast and easy way to make a color scheme without having to rely on mysterious artistic talents (which you may not have) If you&#8217;ve got a project coming up, and you can&#8217;t think of what colors to use, just do this exercise 5-10 times and you&#8217;ll find something you like. Better yet. Save the file as a JPG, email it to the client, and let <em>her</em> pick.</p>

				<p>I was inspired by some <a href="http://hivelogic.com/cigars.html">recent reading</a> to put one of my favorite vices into prose.</p>
<p>I enjoy the martini quite a bit. I have collected the appropriate equipment, developed a method for delivery, and have decided that I am your de-facto expert on the subject.</p>
<h2>What the Martini isn&#8217;t.</h2>
<p>I was out at a bar with friends some years ago, when this character professed to &#8220;love martinis&#8221;. My interest was piqued. He then went on to describe this silly green colored concoction called &#8220;alien zombie something something&#8221;.</p>
<p>I explained how that was, at it&#8217;s very best, a silly cocktail and not a martini.</p>
<p>He protested &#8220;It&#8217;s served in a martini glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well. It&#8217;s a cocktail glass you doof, and secondly if you served dog food and crack in a &#8220;martini&#8221; glass that wouldn&#8217;t make it a martini.</p>
<p>He then went off on a tangent about how &#8220;you can&#8217;t define for me what a martini is&#8221;. Yes, yes. Oppressing freedom of stupidity is a heinous crime.</p>
<p>Anytime something is called a martini, but doesn&#8217;t include chiefly gin or vodka and vermouth with a garnish&#8230;you are dealing with a cocktail. All those apple martinis, chocolate martinis, and other silliness are cocktails which adopt the name martini to sound more official. Like a porn star calling themselves a &#8220;model&#8221;.</p>
<p>These imposters are more rightly called &#8220;fru-fru&#8221; drinks. In my younger days I would have referred to these as &#8220;silly girl drinks&#8221; but time and wisdom has showed me that there are plenty of silly men drinking silly drinks too, and I shouldn&#8217;t be sexist about it.</p>
<h2>What the Martini is.</h2>
<p>The Martini, and I do mean the martini, not a martini. Because despite it&#8217;s many interpretations, the martini is the quint essential cocktail. It is it&#8217;s own symbol. It is roughly a century old, with origins shrouded in mystery. Not even the ubiquitous beer is as instantly recognizable.</p>
<p>The martini is a mixture of gin (or vodka for the uninitiated or gin-phobic) and dry vermouth. There is typically a garnish. Usually a green olive or two. Sometimes a cocktail onion, sometimes a twist of lemon, and sometimes even a ripe, black olive (the Buckeye Martini).</p>
<p>Some would argue that a martini with an onion is in fact a Gibson. That is like arguing that because I wear a different necktie, I should be called by a different name.</p>
<h2>Not So Dry, Please</h2>
<p>Recipes for the martini vary greatly in proportion of the core ingredients, gin and vermouth.</p>
<p>To argue there is a right way to mix a martini is like arguing religion. Very difficult to prove anything, and usually results in a fight.</p>
<p>However I think there are boundaries beyond which we should not go.</p>
<p>Your typical bar will rinse a glass in vermouth, throwing out all but a thin film coating the glass. To this chilled gin is added. Usually from a shaker.</p>
<p>This is the result of people ordering a dry martini&#8230;no dryer!&#8230;over and over again. As if a fishbowl full of cold gin is somehow more appealing than a well proportioned drink.</p>
<p>W.C. Fields advocated the ultra-dry martini, where the vermouth is simply stored near the gin. People take this as some kind of gospel truth, failing to grasp that Fields was a comedian who played the lovable/hatable lush throughout most of his career. A martini with no vermouth is the drink of choice for an alcoholic. It is a sophisticated bit of lush-humor by the great W.C. Fields, not a martini recipe.</p>
<p>A dry alcoholic beverage (wine, sprits, cocktail or otherwise) is a beverage that has a higher alcohol content. On the tongue, it can almost feel if the drink is evaporating on contact. That&#8217;s the dry part. A dry drink is a stronger drink. That of course has a certain appeal among those wishing to get hammered in a hurry. If that&#8217;s your goal, order a few shots of tequila and get down to business.</p>
<h2>My Martini</h2>
<p>My martini calls for 3 to 4 parts gin and 1 part dry vermouth. I find that strikes a nice balance.</p>
<p>Too much gin, and your martini tastes antiseptic. Too much vermouth and your martini will taste like vermouth.</p>
<p>The idea is that the spicy, thick vermouth mingles with the clean, crisp antiseptic gin, cancelling out the negative qualities, leaving you with just the good stuff.</p>
<p>In a good martini you can actually taste the juniper berries in the gin. The spiciness of the vermouth is present, but not loud. The entire drink is cold, clean, and refreshing. It&#8217;s subtle. It makes an excellent aperitif, as it will cleanse your pallette.</p>
<h2>On or Off the Rocks</h2>
<p>A martini straight up is one served in the iconic cocktail glass.</p>
<p>A martini on the rocks is served over ice in a small tumbler or rocks glass.</p>
<p>A martini straight up looks great, tends to be stronger, but gets warmer faster, and is easy to spill if you&#8217;ve had more than one.</p>
<p>A martini on the rocks stays colder, and is less strong, which can be nice for when you want a lighter drink. However if too much ice melts the character of the drink is lost.</p>
<p>Which is better? Yes.</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>I only accept one true variation for the martini, and that is the dirty martini.</p>
<p>The dirty martini includes a splash or two of brine from the olive jar in the mix.</p>
<p>This adds a little salty character to the drink. The dirty martini can be a nice way to introduce the drink to someone who fears stronger drinks.</p>
<p>Variations that call for hot peppers, fruit juices, oddly colored liquors are all inching dangerously close to silly fru-fru drink territory.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>If you are going to serve martinis in your home, a shaker and a couple of glasses are all you will need. Most shakers have a built in strainer-contraption for filtering ice.</p>
<p>You may wish to by a jigger for measuring portions until you feel confident enough to pour by ear.</p>
<p>You cocktail glasses should be of the smaller variety. If you go shopping for martini glasses go for the smaller 3 oz size, not the big-gulp, fish bowl size. The problem with a giant cocktail glass is the tendency to fill it up completely. A proper 3 oz cocktail looks silly in a giant glass&#8230;so people will often over do it.</p>
<p>This leads to hangovers and warm martinis.</p>
<h2>Ingredients.</h2>
<p>There are many fine gins available. I myself like Beefeater and Gordons. Both are fairly priced and of good quality. There are certain blue-bottled brands out there which are of no better quality, but do look smashing in their blue bottle.</p>
<p>If you want a bottle of gin that will look good on your counter, by all means get the blue one. It won&#8217;t taste any better though. And it will cost more.</p>
<p>Martini and Rossi make a decent vermouth, but you can find good brands which are cheaper. I&#8217;ve tried both pricey and inexpensive vermouths, and haven&#8217;t found there to be a significant difference in martini making ability.</p>
<h2>Shaking? Stirring?</h2>
<p>Whatever. Anyone who says they can tell the difference is a lying pompous twit.</p>
<p>Really. Specifying that a bartender stir rather than quickly and efficiently shake is just an experiment in bossing others around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well James Bond said &#8216;Shaken not Stirred&#8217;.&#8221; Yes he did. He also makes martinis with Vodka. He&#8217;s also English. The cocktail, and the martini in particular, is an American invention. Bond simply wouldn&#8217;t know better. Never take culinary advice from the English, even if they are super cool like James Bond.</p>
<h2>Conclusions&#8230;Eating the Olive?</h2>
<p>I feel martinis are best made at home by you. Bars get it wrong, assuming that you want some ultra dry Pine-Sol in a glass. Only you can tweak and adjust the proportions to suit your taste.</p>
<p>And should you eat the olive? Hey. Your house, your rules. If you are out in public, I would suggest only eating the olive if they provide a tasteful handle, like a toothpick or those cute plastic swords. Don&#8217;t go digging around the bottom of a wet glass looking for an olive.</p>
